Transcriber’s Note: Whilst the publishers of the original text intended
it as a facsimile reproduction, this was not considered practical for
an e-text. The original used, for example, scribal abbreviations and
the long s, making it unnecessarily difficult to read. These have been
converted. In addition the mistakes noted in the INDEX ERRATORVM have
been addressed, and a number of other errors (listed at the end) were
picked up on and changed, based on a comparison with another edition of
the same work printed in Paris in 1523.

PUBLISHERS’ NOTE.


The present reproduction of Linacre’s translation of two treatises by
Galen is issued as a specimen of early typography, being the sixth in
order of the seven books printed by John Siberch, the first Cambridge
printer, in 1521. Besides these seven, one appeared in 1522, after which
date no book is known to have been printed in Cambridge till 1584. The
books printed by Siberch are all very scarce; of one but a single copy
is known, and of three of the books there is not a single specimen in
Cambridge. In 1878, the publishers of the present volume proposed to
issue the whole of the eight books, and the following are now ready, and
will shortly be published:

    1. Bullock, Henry. Oratio habita Cantabrigiae. 1521.

    2. Cujusdam fidelis Christiani Epistola ad Christianos omnes.
    Subsequitur et Divi Augustini de miseria … vitæ sermo. 1521.

    8. Papyrii Gemini Eleatis Hermathena, seu de Eloquentiae
    victoria. 1522.

Mr Bradshaw, University Librarian, has compared the eight books side by
side, and has thus been able to determine their relative order. He kindly
allows his notes to be printed, and they will be issued with the first of
the above three volumes.

The Publishers are desirous of gaining information about the printer,
John Siberch, before 1521, when he commenced to print in Cambridge, and
after 1522 when he discontinued printing there. Herbert suggests that he
may be the John Sibert, who was printing at Lyons in 1498, and mentions
a book of that date being in the Cambridge University Library. But this
book, Henrici Bouhic Distinctiones super libros quinque Decretalium,
consists of two large folio volumes, and the printer calls himself
‘_Magister_ Johannes Siberti;’ both of which facts make it unreasonable
to identify him with the plain Johannes Siberch who printed little books
at Cambridge so many years afterwards.

INTRODUCTION.


Thomas Linacre, known to his contemporaries as one of the most learned
scholars of an epoch when learning was highly prized, but in after times
chiefly as the founder of the College of Physicians in London, was born
at Canterbury, probably about the year 1460. Of his parentage and descent
nothing certain is known, though some of his biographers have assumed,
apparently without any evidence except the name, that he was connected
with the family of Linacre in Derbyshire. It is clear from a passage
in Linacre’s will that he had a brother, sisters, and other relatives
(the brother strange to say, bearing the same baptismal name—Thomas) but
further the family history cannot be traced.

This fact will appear less surprising, if we remember that Linacre like
many scholars of his time, was never married, and lived for many years
an almost monastic life, little influenced by family or social ties.
More important than his descent was his education, and in this Linacre
was unusually happy; for not a little of the success and eminence of
his after life may be traced to the bias which the young scholar’s mind
received from his earliest teacher. The Cathedral school of Canterbury
within the monastery of Christ Church where Linacre became a pupil was at
that time under the direction of William Tilly, otherwise called William
of Selling, an Augustinian monk, and a scholar of a type at that time
rare in England. Originally educated at Oxford, elected a Fellow of the
newly founded College of All Souls, and afterwards received as a monk in
the Monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury, Selling found the means to
travel in Italy, where he not only studied the Canon Law, but, what is
more to the present purpose, during a stay at Bologna, studied Greek and
became the pupil of Angelo Politiano. After two years’ stay in Italy, he
returned home, became Prior of Christ Church, and later on was sent as
Envoy from Henry VII. to the papal court; an event which proved of great
importance to Linacre. At the time of which we are now speaking, he was
only Master of the Grammar School, whether appointed before or after
his first journey to Italy we do not know. In any case it is clear that
he had already those tastes and pursuits from which his pupil Linacre
derived not only his determining impulse to the life of a scholar, but
especially that love of Greek literature which runs like a thread through
the great physician’s life and is the clue to much of his versatile
literary activity.

At the mature age (especially according to the customs of the day) of
twenty, Linacre was sent to Oxford. At what College or Hall he studied
is uncertain, though it is assumed, on trivial grounds that he must have
entered at Canterbury Hall. The only fact which is certain is that after
four years’ residence at the University, in 1484, he was elected a fellow
of All Souls’ College. It has been thought by Dr Noble Johnson, the best
biographer of Linacre, that this election must have implied relationship
to Archbishop Chichele, the founder, and thus also to Selling, assuming
that the latter owed his preferment also to family connexions. But the
entry in the College books (which though not contemporary is a copy
thought to have been made about 1571 of the original record) has no
indication of his being of founder’s kin. It is simply “Thomas Lynaker,
_medicus insignis_.” The omission to specify kinship to the founder is
regarded by Dr Leighton the present Warden of All Souls (he was himself
good enough to inform me) as decisive that no such kinship existed, and
the supposition of any family tie between Linacre and Chichele or Selling
must therefore be regarded as entirely baseless[1].

The time of Linacre’s residence at Oxford was one of much moment in the
history of the University, already stirred by the earliest movements of
the revival of learning. The first Oxford printing press was already
issuing those few volumes, now become so rare, which must have been
of startling interest to the world of scholars. The study of the new
learning, Greek, had been introduced by Cornelio Vitali, an Italian,
said to have been the first teacher of that language in England, and it
is stated that Linacre became his pupil. At the same time he doubtless
formed the acquaintance of two scholars who shared his devotion to the
‘new learning,’ William Grocyn and William Latimer, the former of whom
survived to form part, with Linacre himself, of the brilliant circle of
Oxford scholars, who a few years later excited the admiration of Erasmus.

But Linacre was soon to have the privilege which he must have long
coveted, of perfecting his knowledge of Greek at what was then the
fountain-head of that learning, in the schools of Italy. The opportunity
came through his old friend and teacher, William of Selling, who was sent
by Henry the Seventh as his envoy to the Papal Court. It is not clear
that Linacre had any official position in the embassy; he accompanied
his patron however, as far as Bologna, but not in his further journey
to Rome. At Bologna Linacre is stated by Leland to have been introduced
to Angelo Politiano, and to have remained there in order to become a
pupil of this great scholar. His stay in Bologna appears to have been
short, and we next hear of him at Florence, having perhaps followed
thither Politiano, who along with Demetrius Chalcondylas had now been
charged with the instruction of the two sons of Lorenzo de Medici, Piero
and Giovanni. Linacre seems to have been favoured with the patronage of
Lorenzo, who allowed him to share the instructions given to the young
princes. It is not easy to understand precisely what was the position
Linacre now occupied at the Court of Florence, for though his fellow
pupils were boys and he himself a man of twenty-five and already a
considerable scholar, he is not spoken of as in any sense their tutor.
The connexion however must have been in after years valuable to him, as
the dedication of the work now reprinted clearly shews: the pope Leo the
Tenth, being the younger of the two Medici princes. It will be evident
from the dedication itself that the privilege accorded to Linacre was
shared by others, and it was therefore perhaps not so important as it has
been regarded. It is enough to know that he studied under such eminent
scholars as Politiano and Chalcondylas, and thus laid the foundation of
the elegance in Latin scholarship and profundity in Greek learning for
which he was afterwards distinguished.

After a year thus spent in Florence, Linacre proceeded to Rome, where
his studies in the Vatican library procured him the acquaintance of
another great scholar, Hermolaus Barbarus. It is possible that this
acquaintance may have given Linacre’s studies a bias in the direction
of medicine; for Barbarus, though not a physician, had devoted himself
specially to the study of Dioscorides, whose works he translated into
Latin, and illustrated with commentaries, more than once reprinted.
It is suggested by Dr Noble Johnson that the example and arguments of
Hermolaus Barbarus may have given Linacre’s mind a bias of a different
kind, namely towards a single life; for the Italian scholar, we are told,
wrote a treatise in favour of celibacy at the age of eighteen, and never
afterwards deviated either in practice or theory from the principles
there advocated. Barbarus was also a great Aristotelian scholar, and
in this direction also he may have influenced the mind of Linacre; who
afterwards undertook and partly carried out a plan which had also been
among the projects of the elder scholar, of a complete translation of
the works of Aristotle. In other less important matters, the influence
of Hermolaus Barbarus seems traceable, and if Linacre took as his model
in a learned life any of the great scholars with whom he studied, it was
certainly rather Hermolaus than any other.

From Rome Linacre went to Venice, and here made the valuable acquaintance
of the great printer, Aldus Manutius Romanus, who was then engaged in
bringing out some of the most important editions of the classics, by
which he earned the gratitude of scholars. Aldus appears to have treated
the English scholar with great kindness, which is acknowledged, as a
personal favour, by William Grocyn, in a letter to Aldus, which must
have been written shortly after Linacre’s return from Italy. After
acknowledging the kindness shewn to his friend Linacre, Grocyn goes
on to thank Aldus, in the name of English scholars especially for his
editions of the Greek classics, and commends his preference for Aristotle
to Plato. The rest of this letter, the style of which is praised by
Erasmus, is interesting, especially as the only extant composition,
except two trifling epigrams, of this once celebrated scholar, but has
no further reference to our subject. Aldus prefixed it to Linacre’s
translation of Proclus _On the Sphere_, printed by him in the year
1499[2], in order (as he says in his dedication of this work to Albertus
Pius, prince of Carpi) to make the Italian philosophers ashamed of their
bad Latin, and lead them to rival the Englishmen. In the dedication just
named Aldus pays a high compliment to Linacre’s scholarship, which may be
quoted here, though written later. “Linacre,” he says, “has translated
this work with elegance and learning.

“Qui utinam et Simplicium in Aristotelis Physica, et in ejusdem meteora
Alexandrum quos nunc summâ curâ Latinos facit, ad me dedisset, ut et
illos unâ cum Proclo ad te mitterem. Quanquam (ut spero) eosque et alios
in Philosophiâ, medicinâque perutiles libros aliquando dabit. ut ex eâdem
Britanniâ unde olim barbaræ et indoctæ literæ ad nos profectæ Italiam
occuparunt, et adhuc arces tenent, latine et docte loquentes bonas artes
accipiamus, ac britannicis adjutoribus fugatâ barbarie, arces nostras
recipiamus, ut eâdem hastâ sanetur a quâ illatum est vulnus.”

He also implies that an intimate friendship existed between Linacre and
the prince of Carpi, on which account the work will be more welcome to
his patron.

The Aldine _editio princeps_ of Aristotle contains also an interesting
allusion to Linacre, which seems to shew that he had something to do with
the editing or correcting of that great work. It may even not be without
some significance that a splendid copy of this edition, printed on vellum
(and as complete in this state, according to Dibdin, of the highest
rarity), once belonged to Linacre, and is now, bearing his autograph, in
the library of New College, Oxford. In the dedication prefixed to the
second volume of this work, Aldus boasts of the pains he had taken to
secure a correct text,

“Ut tum querendis optimis et antiquis libris atque eâdem in re
multiplicibus tum conferendis castigandisque exemplaribus quæ dilaceranda
impressoribus traderentur, perirentque ut pariens vipera, in manus
hominum venirent emendatissima. Id ita sit necne sunt mihi gravissimi
testes in totâ fere Italiâ, et præcipue in Venetiis Thomas Anglicus,
homo et græce et latine peritissimus præcellensque in doctrinarum omnium
disciplinis.”

This volume is dated February, 1497, the first volume 1495, dates which
are quite reconcilable with the time when Linacre is believed to have
been at Venice.

On leaving Venice, Linacre went to Padua and probably made some stay
there: since it was here that he graduated as Doctor of Medicine, and
here he must have acquired the greatest part of his medical knowledge.
Padua was at that time one of the chief seats of medical knowledge
in Europe, and became shortly afterwards one of the first schools of
anatomy. Its reputation in both departments was long preserved under
the enlightened patronage of the Venetian Senate. Many students from
Northern Europe naturally flocked thither, and among them a few from
England and Scotland. Linacre was not the first eminent English scholar
who graduated in medicine at Padua; the once celebrated Phreas [Wells],
who left Balliol for Italy, and died at Rome, having preceded him by half
a century or more; but he was followed by a long roll of English and
Scottish students the names and escutcheons of some of whom may still be
seen in the gallery of the University quadrangle.

Though Linacre is said to have taken the degree of Doctor of Medicine
with great distinction, there is no foundation for the assertion that he
was ever _Professor_ of Medicine in the University. The story rests on
an obvious confusion of the titles of Doctor and Professor which were
then and long afterwards equivalent and interchangeable in the European
Universities.

The tradition of Linacre’s successful disputation at Padua is preserved
in a dialogue by Richard Pacey (quoted in Johnson’s life) where Grammar
and Rhetoric are made to dispute as to the respective merits of Theodore
Gaza and Thomas Linacre. Grammar first claims Linacre as her own,
Rhetoric contends that he was by right her son, and that Grammar was only
the occupation of his leisure moments. On one occasion (says Rhetoric) he
condescended to dispute with some Grammarian on certain minutiæ connected
with the vocative case, but gained a more brilliant victory when he
defended his theses for graduation at Padua, “Nam quum in gymnasio
Patavino, professionis artis medicæ ei (ut nunc moris est) darentur
insignia, publicé non sine summâ laude disputavit, et seniorum medicorum
adversaria argumenta accuratissime refellit”[3].

Linacre’s route after leaving Padua, may, Dr Johnson tells us, be
accurately and precisely traced through Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Bergamo
and Milan; but the authority for this statement is not given. It may
however be permissible to delay for a moment at Vicenza, since it is
pretty certain that Linacre did pass there, and highly probable that
his stay had some influence on his literary life. This city was the
home of a celebrated physician and scholar, Nicolaus Leonicenus, best
known as the author of the earliest treatise on Syphilis, the fearful
malady at that time beginning to be known; but also celebrated for having
translated several works of Galen from the Greek. One of these versions,
that of the treatise _De motû musculorum_ was afterwards published by
Linacre with some of his own. Leonicenus was much older than Linacre
(though he survived him) and in after years, as we know from a letter of
Croke to Henry VIII., spoke of Linacre as his pupil[4].

The reputation of this now almost forgotten scholar was very high among
his contemporaries. Aldus Romanus, in the dedication of the Aristotle
already spoken of to Albertus Pius, Prince of Carpi, speaks of Leonicenus
as ‘_philosophorum ætatis nostræ medicorumque facile princeps_’. A
correspondence which has been preserved between Leonicenus and Angelus
Politianus is full of mutual compliments; and shews that the two scholars
regarded themselves as allies in the common warfare against ‘barbarism’ a
foe that had to be expelled from the fields of philosophy and medicine as
well as from that of letters[5].

It is certain that the example of such a man could not have been without
effect on so apt a pupil as Linacre, and the influence of Vicenza is
clearly apparent in some of his later work.

On leaving Italy, Linacre is said to have indulged in an antiquarian
caprice which seems little in harmony with what we afterwards hear of
his staid character, though in his hot youth and under the influence of
the classical sentiment it may have been possible, and even natural.
The story is that on bidding farewell to Italy at some mountain pass he
indulged his fancy in building a cairn of stones, which he crowned with
flowers, and dedicated to Italy, as _sancta mater studiorum_. All that is
known about this transaction comes from two Latin poems, by Janus Vitalis
and by Joannes Latomus, one of which it may be sufficient to quote.

                   JANUS VITALES

       IN THOMÆ LINACRI ANGLI ITALIA DISCESSUM.

    Dum Linacrus adit Morinos, patriosque Britannos,
      Artibus egregiis dives ab Italiâ,
    Ingentem molem saxorum in rupibus altis,
      Congerit ad fauces ante Gebenna tuas,
    Floribus hinc, viridique struem dum fronde coronat,
      Et sacer Assyrias pascitur ignis opes:
    “Hoc tibi” ait “mater studiorum, ô sancta meorum
      Templum Linacrus dedicat, Italia;
    Tu modò cui doctâ assurgunt cum Pallade Athenæ
      Hoc de me pretium sedulitatis habe.”

The second poem is by Joannes Latomus, and entitled _Arnidis querela in
Thomam Linacrum Anglum Italiâ discessurum_. It represents the nymph of
the Arno expostulating with Linacre while engaged in erecting his altar,
on his fixed resolution to return home. It is highly laudatory, but too
long for quotation[6].

In both copies of verses the name _Gebenna_ occurs in connexion with
this incident, and as this usually means, in classical Latin, the
mountain district called the Cevennes, Dr Johnson concludes that Linacre
before pursuing his journey to Paris stayed in this district. It does
not seem necessary to suppose that he took so circuitous a route, or
visited a part of the country which must at that time have been wild
and little traversed, and where a scholar, uninfluenced by modern love
of the picturesque can have found nothing to attract him. But _Civitas
Gebennensis_ is the name given, almost universally, by the printers of
Linacre’s time, to the city of Geneva, and Stephanus:—_Dictionarium
nominum propriorum_ gives an interpretation apparently identical. We can
well believe that, in crossing the pass of the great St Bernard on his
way down to Geneva, Linacre would not bid farewell to the southern side
of the Alps without some expression of emotion. But too much importance
must not be attached to a story which probably rested only on some
trifling incident of travel in crossing the Alps, related by Linacre
himself in writing to his Italian friends.

The name _Morinos_ in the verses quoted above sufficiently indicates
that Linacre returned home, or was expected to return by way of Calais.
He must doubtless have passed through Paris, but we have no record of
any acquaintanceship there, though certainly at a later time Linacre had
literary correspondents and friends in that city.

On his return to England Linacre seems to have resumed his residence in
All Souls’ College. His position in the University must have been one of
considerable eminence, since a knowledge of Greek was still confined to a
few scholars, and great respect was paid to those who had acquired this
new accomplishment in Italy. There were about this time or a little later
but four such scholars in Oxford. Grocyn and Latimer were a little older
than Linacre. Colet was younger, or, at least, visited Italy later, and
the date of his stay in Florence gave his studies a somewhat different
complexion from what we see in Linacre. It has been well pointed out by
Mr Seebohm, in his work on the Oxford Reformers[7], that Colet was at
Florence during the agitation and enthusiasm aroused by the preaching of
Savonarola, and doubtless derived from him that new spirit in theology
which his after life displayed, and which has caused him to be reckoned
among the precursors of the reformation. Grocyn and Linacre shew nothing
of this. They knew Florence when the literary _renaissance_ was at
its height, and when the spirit of the learned world was more pagan
than Christian. We shall notice afterwards what bearing this had upon
Linacre’s literary and theological position.

The dissertation which the newly-returned scholar read for his degree in
medicine is said to have attracted attention, but he does not seem to
have taught publicly;—at least Grocyn and Latimer are the only names we
hear of as public lecturers on Greek. It was, however, Linacre’s good
fortune, at this time, to meet with a pupil whose subsequent eminence
was enough to make his teacher distinguished, with whom he formed the
most important literary friendship of his life, and who has left us the
brightest and most life-like pictures of Linacre himself. This pupil was
Erasmus, whose long-cherished plans of going to Italy to learn Greek
were, as is well known, deferred, in order that he might visit England
with the same object. The story of Erasmus’ stay in Oxford has often
been told, though never before so fully and clearly as in Mr Seebohm’s
volume already referred to. It is very likely that he may have derived
from Colet some of the ideas which afterwards influenced his literary and
theological activity. To Linacre he owed, undoubtedly, the foundation
of his Greek scholarship, and his respect for the ability and character
of his teacher are shewn in many well-known passages from his letters.
In one of the best known he writes as follows: “In Colet I hear Plato
himself. Who does not admire the perfect compass of science in Grocyn?
What can be more acute, more profound, or more refined than the judgment
of Linacre?” There are many similar passages, and, though eulogy was
the fashion of the age, we feel at once that, at least in speaking of
Linacre, Erasmus meant what he said. The same impression must be derived,
I think, from an amusing passage in the “Encomium Moriæ,” though some of
Linacre’s biographers seem to have omitted it as if derogatory to his
reputation. It is, however, written in a strain of good-natured banter,
which shews that there was a foundation of good feeling and mutual
respect between the two scholars.

“Novi quendam πολυτεχνότατον Græcum, Latinum, Mathematicum, philosophum
medicum καὶ ταῦτα βασιλικὸν jam sexagenarium qui cæteris rebus omissis
annis plus viginti se torquet et discruciat in Grammaticâ, prorsus
felicem se fore ratus si tamdiu licet vivere, donec certo statuat,
quomodo distinguendæ sint octo partes orationis, quod hactenus nemo
Græcorum aut Latinorum ad plenum præstare valuit. Proinde quasi res
sit bello quoque vindicanda, si quis conjunctionem faciat dictionem ad
adverbiorum jus pertinentem[8].”

There is no record of Linacre’s practice in his profession at Oxford.
A new direction was given to his life by the call which he received
about the year 1501 to come to court, and direct the studies of the
young Prince Arthur. This mark of court favour appears to have been in
some way connected with the visit of Prince Arthur to the University
where he resided in Magdalen College. The appointment lasted till the
prince’s death in 1503, but the only record of it which remains is the
Latin translation of the treatise of Proclus _On the Sphere_, dedicated
to Prince Arthur, which has been already referred to. This was Linacre’s
earliest published work. After the prince’s death Linacre appears to have
stayed in London, and probably to have practised medicine, but there is
no satisfactory evidence as to this period of his life.

The accession of Henry VIII. must have raised the hopes of Linacre,
as it did those of all the scholars and enlightened men in England at
that time. The young king, known to be learned himself and a favourer
of learning, was expected to give a powerful stimulus to the progress
of the new studies. Erasmus was urged by his friends to return to
England to share the prosperity and splendour of the new reign. A new
epoch of enlightenment was to commence, and a final blow was to be
given to all those evils and abuses which the scholars summed up in
the word barbarism. It is well known that these hopes were not at all,
or very imperfectly, realized, but Linacre himself had no reason for
disappointment. He was made the royal physician, a post, in those days,
of great influence and importance in other than professional matters, as
is shewn by a curious letter addressed to Linacre by the University of
Oxford. From this, as from other events, it is clear that Linacre did
not, while at court, forget his old mistress, learning, but used his
influence as far as possible for her advancement. He is described by a
contemporary and friend George Lilly, as conspicuous among the chief
persons of the court in a purple robe and a hood of black silk[9]. Among
his other patients are mentioned the great prelates Wolsey, Warham, and
Fox.

After some years of professional activity, and when he was about fifty
years of age, Linacre appears to have taken holy orders; or possibly at
this time merely proceeded to priest’s orders, having been previously
deacon. The simplest explanation of this step is that which is given by
himself in the dedication of his translation of _Galen de Naturalibus
Facultatibus_ to Archbishop Warham, namely, that he hoped to get more
leisure for literary work. It is supposed that he prepared himself
for the sacred office by entering, in mature life, upon the study of
theology, and a curious story is told in connexion with his first reading
of the New Testament, which, as it has been strangely misunderstood,
may be worth giving in detail. The story rests solely on the authority
of Sir John Cheke, Professor of Greek at Cambridge, in his letters
on the pronunciation of Greek, addressed to Bishop Gardiner, at that
time Chancellor of the University. Cheke seems to have been anxious to
conciliate the Bishop, and at the same time, for some reason or other,
to depreciate Linacre. He speaks of him as a learned person and a good
physician, but one who should not venture out of his own province, and,
he says, in power of rhetoric and popular expression far inferior to the
episcopal correspondent to whom Cheke’s letters were addressed[10].

He then tells the following story. Linacre when advanced in life, his
health broken by study and disease, and near his end, took the New
Testament in his hand for the first time, (although he was a priest,) and
read the Gospel of St Matthew to the end of the 7th Chapter (that is to
the end of the Sermon on the Mount). Having read it, he threw the volume
away with all the strength he could muster, swearing “either this is not
the Gospel or we are not Christians.” It is probable that the striking
contrast between the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount and the practice
of the Christian World has inspired many readers with the same feeling,
and it will continue to have the same effect on many more, though they
may not happen to give vent to their surprise with the same petulance.
Cheke seems to argue that it shewed some scepticism in Linacre or want
of respect for the Scriptures. Selden has misunderstood the story still
more strangely, imagining that Linacre referred only or chiefly to
the prohibition of swearing. But looked at without prejudice Linacre’s
exclamation seems natural enough. It is well known that the Scholars of
the _renaissance_, before the time of Erasmus at least, were very little
acquainted with the Scriptures in the original text, or even in the Latin
Vulgate Version, which is said to have been avoided on account of its
non-classical idioms. Now Linacre was a scholar and not a theologian. A
theologian by profession either passes lightly over discrepancies such
as these or else has already found such an explanation of them as is
possible. But the spirit of scholarship and criticism is to take words
in their true meaning and to view ideas by uncoloured light. Linacre’s
remark needs no other explanation than that he read the passage with the
unbiassed judgment of a scholar.

Although it is clear that Linacre entered the Church under the patronage
of Archbishop Warham he is said to have been ordained priest by the
Bishop of London on Decʳ 22ⁿᵈ 1520. The date of his entrance into
deacon’s orders is unknown. It has been conjectured that he received
from Pope Leo the Tenth, his old schoolfellow, a dispensation from the
necessity of passing through the inferior clerical degrees, and that
this may have been the kindness for which he expresses his gratitude in
the dedication of the present volume. Be this as it may, he received
from Warham in 1509 his first preferment to the Rectory of Merstham in
Kent, which he resigned in a little more than a month from his collation.
In the same year he received the Prebend of Easton in Gardano in the
Cathedral of Wells, and in the same year the living of Hawkhurst, in
Kent, which he held till the year 1524. Further marks of favour were
bestowed upon him in 1517, when he was made Canon and Prebendary of
Westminster, and in 1518 when he acquired the Prebend of South Newbold
in the Cathedral of York. He resigned the latter preferment on receiving
the important appointment of Precentor in the same York Cathedral, but
resigned this also in the same year. Two other benefices are recorded as
having been bestowed upon him, the Rectory of Holworthy in Devonshire by
the King, in 1518, and in 1520 the Rectory of Wigan, in Lancashire, on
the title of which he received priest’s orders, Dec. 22, 1520, and which
he held till his death[11].

There is no evidence that Linacre resided at any one of the benefices or
Cathedral appointments which he received. In fact it is most probable,
though not absolutely certain, that he continued to live in his London
house. His biographers then have been somewhat puzzled to account for
his accepting so many preferments and resigning most of them so soon.
But it is probable that a physician and scholar did not hold more
rigid notions respecting the evils of pluralism than his more strictly
clerical contemporaries and that he saw no harm in holding a benefice
of which he could not discharge the duty or only did so by deputy. The
speedy resignation of a benefice is no evidence that the preferment was
unprofitable. It is probable that in accordance with the common custom
he resigned only in favour of a consideration paid by an aspirant who
desired to be presented to the office, and was willing to pay the holder
to vacate it. Such a practice has lasted in regard to secular offices
almost to our own time[12]. Linacre must be judged not by the system
which, whatever its faults, gave him leisure for literary work and plans
of public usefulness, but by the manner in which he employed the wealth
which these benefices placed at his disposal. It must have been from this
source that he obtained funds for his munificent endowments.

The firstfruits of his renewed literary activity did not appear till
the year 1517, eighteen years after his first work, when he published
his translation into Latin of the six Books of Galen, _De Sanitate
Tuendâ_. This version was printed in a fine folio by Rubeus, of Paris,
and dedicated to Henry VIII. The dedication of this work shews the
reverence in which the writings of Galen were held, a point of which
we shall have to speak again. It is also interesting since it tells us
that many scholars of Italy, France, and Germany, but especially the two
great lights of the age, Erasmus and Budæus, had repeatedly urged him to
publish this work. The Preface addressed to the reader contains a great
many Greek words, which may perhaps be the reason why the work was not
printed in England, where no Greek type probably existed at this time,
as will be seen from Siberch’s introduction to the work now reprinted. A
vellum copy of this book presented to Cardinal Wolsey is still preserved
in the British Museum with the original letter which accompanied it.
Another copy presented to Bishop Fox is now in the library of the College
of Physicians, and has a dedicatory letter written at the beginning, but
I cannot think it to be Linacre’s own handwriting.

Two years later appeared the translation of Galen’s _Methodus Medendi_,
in bulk one of the greatest of his works, and in substance one of the
most obscure. It is not now easy to understand the admiration and
gratitude with which scholars received his translation. The work itself
was known by name only to most, and perhaps on that account was the
more respected. The judgment of Dr Johnson, Linacre’s biographer, is as
follows:—“Not less formidable in its length than incomprehensible in
many of the theories contained in it. The sentence pronounced by the
Mufti on the verses of the Turkish poet Missi, whose meaning he declared
to be intelligible to none save to God and to him by whom they were
composed, may with equal truth be applied to the doctrine which this book
inculcates.” This translation also was dedicated to Henry 8th and it is
curious that Linacre speaks of it as the third work published under the
protection of the Royal name, though no other is known than that already
mentioned, unless the allusion be to the dedication of his translation
of Proclus to the King’s elder brother, Prince Arthur. It is further
introduced by some commendatory verses from the pen of Janus Lascaris.
It was beautifully printed in folio by Desiderius Maheu, at Paris, in
1519. A presentation copy sent to Cardinal Wolsey with the complimentary
letter which accompanied it is still preserved in the British Museum.
Both the above-mentioned versions have been frequently reprinted at Paris
and elsewhere, and, with a few alterations, have been accepted as the
standard translations of those works of Galen.

The next work published by Linacre was the translation now reproduced
of which we need not speak further at this point. The dedication to
Pope Leo the Tenth is, as will be seen, inspired by a recollection of
the writer’s early friendship with the great Pontiff, when they were
fellow-pupils of Politian and Chalcondylas. One passage in this letter is
still obscure, that in which he refers to some recent and striking proof
of the Pontiff’s munificence, shared in common with others, who had been
also his schoolfellows at Florence. It has been suggested that this act
of kindness may have been some dispensation which facilitated Linacre’s
entrance into Holy Orders. If there were any such dispensation, it is
more likely that it was one enabling him to hold a benefice, while still
a deacon, or perhaps even a layman, since we find that Linacre’s first
clerical preferment was given him in the year of Henry the Eighth’s
accession, which must also have been that of Linacre’s appointment as
Court Physician, and it seems highly improbable that his ordination
should have taken place almost simultaneously with this appointment. But
there is no proof that any dispensation whatever was referred to, and it
is quite possible that the Pope’s generosity may have been shewn in some
other way, such as by some valuable present, since this might have been,
what a dispensation could not have been, bestowed alike on his other old
schoolfellows.

Two other translations from Galen, were published by Linacre during his
lifetime, one the treatise _De Naturalibus Facultatibus_ in the year 1523
by Pynson, in London, and a short tract _De Pulsuum Usû_, either in the
same year or in the next, which was the last year of Linacre’s life. Two
other translations, _De Symptomatum Differentiis_ and _De Symptomatum
Causis_, were printed by Pynson after the writer’s death.

Two grammatical works must also be mentioned as occupying some part of
Linacre’s later years; the _Rudimenta Grammatices_ was composed for the
use of the Princess Mary, and is in English, though its title is Latin.
It was afterwards translated into Latin by George Buchanan, and in this
form published at Paris.

A more elaborate work entitled _De Emendatâ structurâ_ was not printed
until the year 1524, but from the history of its composition must have
been written about 14 years earlier. Linacre’s old friend Dean Colet,
the founder of St Paul’s School, desiring to have for the use of his
school a better grammar than any which already existed, appears to have
asked Linacre to compose a suitable work. The treatise of which we are
now speaking resulted, but when produced it was thought to be, in bulk
and difficulty, quite beyond the comprehension of young pupils. Colet
accordingly thought himself obliged to decline it, and substituted a
much shorter compendium written by himself, or William Lily, or by
both jointly, which was afterwards revised by Erasmus and reprinted by
Cardinal Wolsey for the use of Ipswich School. This was the foundation
of the well-known Lily’s Grammar. Linacre appears to have been annoyed
at the rejection of his Grammar, and a breach was thus made in his
friendship with Colet, which never appears to have been healed. Erasmus
vainly endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation. This was the best
known work published by Linacre in the domain of scholarship; several
editions were printed by Estienne at Paris, and many others in other
European cities. To some is prefixed a laudatory preface by Melanchthon.
It is not quite clear whether it was published before or immediately
after the author’s death.

The works now mentioned were, in combination with medical practice, the
occupation of the last 14 years of Linacre’s life. It is impossible
to say exactly at what time he gave up the active practice of his
profession. The only passage which might be supposed to throw any
light on the subject, is one in the dedication of the translation of
_De Naturalibus Facultatibus_ to Archbishop Warham, where he speaks
gratefully of the leisure afforded by the assumption of the priestly
office conferred on him by Warham[13]. But as the only certain instance
of his receiving a benefice from the Archbishop, was that of the rectory
of Merstham, in 1509, the year in which Linacre entered upon his
duties as Court Physician, it seems that some later preferment or else
ordination, must be referred to. It is possible therefore, that he may
have only gradually given up practice.

But Linacre rendered a service to medicine far more important than any
of his writings, by the foundation of the College of Physicians and it
is for this that he has been and will continue to be held in grateful
remembrance. In order to understand the importance and utility of
Linacre’s conception we must remember that up to this time medicine could
not be said to have existed as a distinct profession in England. The two
classes of physicians and surgeons were very widely separated. The former
were chiefly ecclesiastics and so far as any authorization was necessary
to allow them to practice they received their authority from the Bishops
or Archbishops. A statute passed in the 3rd year of Henry VIII. (3 Henry
VIII. Cap. 11.) exhibits a first attempt to remedy this deficiency. It
is there recited that “forasmuch as the science and cunning of physic
and chirurgy to the perfect knowledge whereof be requisite both great
learning and ready experience is daily in this realm exercised by great
multitudes of ignorant persons of whom the greater part have no manner
of insight in the same nor in any other kind of learning; some also can
know no letters on the book, so far that common artificers as smiths,
weavers, and women boldly and customarily take upon them great cures
of things of great difficulty in the which they partly use sorcery and
witchcraft, and partly apply such medicines unto the disease as be very
noyous and are not meet therefor, to the high displeasure of God, great
infamy to the faculty, and the grievous hurt, damage, and destruction
of many of the King’s liege people, most especially of them that cannot
discern the uncunning from the cunning.” It is then provided that no one
should practise as a physician or surgeon within the City of London or
seven miles from the same except he be examined and proved by the Bishop
of London or by the Dean of Paul’s with the aid of doctors of Physic and
experts in surgery. In other parts of the country the duty of proving
medical practitioners was assigned to the Bishop of the Diocese.

We do not know whether Linacre’s influence was in any way concerned in
getting this Statute passed. A few years afterwards, in the year 1518,
Royal letters patent were granted for the carrying out of the scheme in
which Linacre was concerned and which was in all probability framed by
him. The letters were addressed to John Chambre, Thomas Linacre, and
Fernandus de Victoria, together with three other physicians also named,
and all men of the same faculty in London. These were to be incorporated
as one perpetual commonalty or College, to have the power of electing
a President, the use of a common seal, the liberty of holding lands in
fee and of purchasing lands whose annual value did not exceed £12. They
were permitted to make statutes for regulating the practice of physic in
London and for seven miles round, and received the important privilege of
punishing offenders by fine or imprisonment.

These letters were dated 23rd September in the 10th year of Henry VIII.
Four years after the privileges thereby granted were confirmed and
extended by a Statute (14 & 15 Henry VIII. Cap. 5). By this Statute the
privileges of the College were extended over the whole of England, no
person being allowed to practise physic without having been examined
and licensed by the President of the College and three of the elect.
The reason given for this extension of privilege was the difficulty of
finding in each diocese men able to sufficiently examine those who were
to be admitted physicians. The graduates of Oxford or Cambridge who had
accomplished all their exercises in due form without any grace were alone
allowed to practise without a licence. The privileges of the College were
confirmed and enlarged by several subsequent Statutes and Letters Patent
in the reign of King James the First, in the Protectorate of Cromwell,
and at other times. Among other powers conferred by James the First
was that of examining into the purity and goodness of all apothecaries’
wares kept in the houses of apothecaries and druggists in London. This
right was exercised up till the beginning of this century and a similar
inspection or visitation of drugs is still performed by Government
Assessors in Germany.

Comparing the College of Physicians with the bodies which exercised the
same rights in other countries in the sixteenth century we see that the
chief justification for its existence was the fact that no University
or Faculty of Medicine existed in London. In Paris, for instance, and
in other University cities very similar privileges were given to the
Faculty, that is to say, to the Doctors of Medicine of the University. It
would have been a serious curtailment of University privileges to have
founded in those cities any body like the College of Physicians. Linacre,
who was so well acquainted with the learned bodies of Italy and France,
must doubtless have felt the want in London of a learned body with the
name and dignity of the University. His College was doubtless intended to
take the place of the University so far as medicine was concerned. There
is, however, no hint of any provision for teaching.

Beside the ostensible object of preventing the practice of medicine by
ignorant persons, the foundation of the College effected another equally
important reform which may possibly have been foreseen and intended by
its founders, although the intention was not avowed. This was nothing
else than the liberation of medicine and the medical profession from
the control of the Church. The Bishops, it is said, notwithstanding the
formal abolition of their privileges, continued to license physicians
for 180 years after the foundation of the College, but never since has
any ecclesiastical authority controlled the status or the practice of
the medical profession in England. This liberty could hardly have been
so complete had medicine been as completely as in other countries a
department of University teaching. Linacre’s foundation must have the
credit of preserving medicine both from the immediate domination of
clerics and from future subjection to the leaden rule of orthodoxy, which
swayed for several centuries the English Universities. The conditions of
the new College and the mode of admission into it were clearly designed,
and were calculated to give a very definite stamp to the English
physician. He was to be in the first place a man of learning, and in this
respect the standard of the College was certainly higher than that of the
Universities, as is clear from the history of certain controversies that
arose between these authorities. Considering too that it was scarcely
possible to obtain in this country the particular kind of learning
required, a strong inducement was held out to physicians to study at the
Universities of the Continent, especially in Italy. Hence physicians
were not only learned but very often travelled persons; and the names of
foreigners are found rather frequently in the early rolls of the College.
Moreover as the number of physicians practising in London was not large,
and the difficulties of obtaining a licence were so considerable, a
physician had no doubt a social position very much above that of the
surgeon, and perhaps relatively higher than at the present day. It must
be admitted also that the standing of an English physician has been made
more definite and further removed from any association with trade than in
any other European country. We see then pretty clearly what was the ideal
that Linacre had framed;—a grave and learned person, well read in Galen,
respecting, but not bowing down to, the prestige of the Universities,
claiming for his own science a dignity apart from, but not conflicting
with, that of theology, looking upon surgeons and apothecaries with
charity, but not without a sense of his own superiority.

Such was to be the English Physician, and Linacre succeeded, if such was
his object, in moulding a definite type of character which lasted for two
centuries at least. But the physician of Linacre’s school is no more;—his
epitaph was written nearly a hundred years ago by no less a person than
Samuel Johnson. The great lexicographer was asked upon his death-bed
for what physician he had sent. “I have sent,” he said, “for Heberden,
_ultimum Romanorum_, the last of our learned physicians.”

The further history of the College of Physicians need not be written
here; but something must be said of two other foundations also due to
the public spirit and far-seeing benevolence of Linacre. These were his
readerships at Oxford and Cambridge. In order to provide for the public
teaching of medicine in the University and more especially for the
reading of the works of Hippocrates and Galen, Linacre shortly before his
death transferred to trustees considerable landed estates producing about
£30 a year, which it was no doubt intended should be conveyed directly
to the Universities for the foundation of Readerships. But the manner in
which his purpose was carried out was unsatisfactory, and the subsequent
history of the foundations is a melancholy chapter in University
annals. The four trustees were Sir Thomas More, Tunstall, Bishop of
London, Stokesley, himself afterwards a bishop and a certain Sheriff, a
lawyer. For reasons which it is difficult to understand, unless simply
negligence and procrastination were responsible, nothing was done with
these funds till the reign of Edward VI., when Tunstall, the surviving
trustee, transferred part of the estate to Merton College, Oxford, for
the foundation of two Readers, and another part to St John’s College,
Cambridge, for the establishment of a Readership there. It is quite clear
that Linacre intended these to be University and not college foundations.
His intention is sufficiently established by a letter addressed to him
by the University of Oxford which has been published by Dr Johnson. The
University acknowledges “that peculiar affection towards our commonwealth
by which you have rendered yourself specially eminent,” and speaks of
the splendid lectures “which you have appointed to be read here at your
expense as wisely devoted to the study of medicine.” This might seem to
refer to a foundation already established, but for the concluding words
of the letter, “Lastly, we earnestly and again and again implore you not
to abandon the resolution you have undertaken, and that your intentions
may never be so many and varied as to divert or overcrowd this project.
Let us certainly hope that the restoration of these, as well as all other
studies to their pristine dignity may be effected during your life, and
if aught in our power can promote this most excellent design, believe
us prepared to second your wishes. Farewell, and may you long enjoy
life, chief patron of learning!” According to Anthony Wood, Linacre’s
foundation was settled in Merton College instead of in the University,
on account of the great decay of the University in the reign of Edward
VI., and through the persuasion of Dr Reynolds, warden of Merton College.
This College was moreover for some reason specially frequented by the
students of medicine. The appointment of readers, originally the duty of
the trustees, was now transferred to the College. Members of the College
had a preference for the appointment; though if none were found properly
qualified, a member of another College or Hall might be appointed. The
appointment was for three years only. With our present experience of
University history, it is easy to see that no system could have been
better calculated to reduce Linacre’s great foundation to uselessness and
obscurity.

The names of a few of the earlier readers are given by Wood; that of one
only, Dr Robert Barnes, emerges from total obscurity. The Readerships
soon became sinecures, and their stipends were regarded as nothing more
than an agreeable addition to the incomes of two of the Fellows. Among
the many similar instances of the misapplication of endowments we shall
not easily find a grosser abuse. Twenty years ago, as is well known,
the Oxford Commissioners revived the name of the Founder in the present
flourishing Linacre Professorship of Anatomy so ably filled, so important
in the history of science in Oxford, and provided for its endowment by
Merton College, as an equivalent for the income which the College still
derives from Linacre’s estates.

At Cambridge the history of the corresponding Readership was even more
unfortunate. The appointment was given to St John’s College, and though
it was at first provided that the lectures of Linacre’s Reader should
be delivered in the Schools of the University, the office soon came to
be regarded as nothing more than a college sinecure. Moreover, through
bad management of the funds, or chiefly, I believe, through an imprudent
exchange of the estate originally settled by Linacre for one which has
turned out to be of less value, the income originally intended for the
Readership seems to have been lost. But for the sake of other than
Cambridge men it ought to be here stated that the present Linacre Reader
of Pathology fills with credit a chair most inadequately endowed, and has
revived in Cambridge the public teachings of a study perfectly congruous
with, though different from that which was intended by the founder. It
is impossible to doubt that Linacre looked forward to founding what
should essentially be a school of medicine in each University. And it is
a strange instance of the irony of fate, that Cambridge at the present
day comes far nearer to carrying out the plans of the great scholar than
his own University of Oxford, to which he always shewed the loyalty of
an affectionate son, and on which he conferred the largest share of his
munificent bounty.

In the year 1524 it became evident to Linacre that his health was
breaking, and in June of that year he executed his will. He appears
to have suffered much from the painful disease, stone in the bladder,
which finally carried him off on the 20th October, 1524, at the age, as
is supposed, of sixty-four. His death was a great loss to the cause of
learning in England, and many passages in the letters of contemporary
scholars will shew that it was not less felt in all learned circles
throughout Europe. He was buried in the Old Cathedral of St Paul, but for
more than thirty years no memorial appears to have marked his grave. This
strange neglect was only supplied in the year 1557 by the great physician
John Caius, a name memorable in Cambridge annals, who if not personally
a pupil of Linacre was in the most complete sense the inheritor of his
spirit, and the most perfect type of a physician, such as the founder of
our College wished to see. The Latin epitaph, written no doubt by Caius
himself, perished in the great fire of London, but has been preserved by
Dugdale. After an enumeration of the learned works and public services of
Linacre it sketches in a few words a fine character, “Fraudes dolosque
mire perosus; fidus amicis; omnibus ordinibus juxta carus.”

It will hardly be necessary to supplement the terse eulogium pronounced
by Caius, by any attempt to sum up Linacre’s moral excellences.
But it may be worth while to form some estimate of the talents
and accomplishments which gave him so high a reputation among his
contemporaries. No original writing of Linacre’s has been preserved,
except his grammatical works and a few dedications and letters, on
the strength of which it would be absurd to hazard any generalization
as to his intellectual power. His reputation rested and still rests
upon his translations; together with the undefined, but unmistakably
strong impression which he produced upon his friends and literary
contemporaries. From them we should gather that it was to the
multifariousness of Linacre’s attainments as well as his excellence in
each, that he owed his renown. To his literary faculty there are many
testimonies. His Latin writing was thought to be so good that according
to the friendly eulogium of Erasmus, the works of Galen as interpreted
by Linacre, spoke better Latin than they had before spoken Greek. Other
opinions not less laudatory were expressed both by Erasmus himself in
other places and by other scholars not less sensitive in the matter
of style. Linacre was not, however, a slavish imitator of any master.
Erasmus among others has preserved the tradition of his slight regard
for Cicero. He would rather have been thought to write like Quinctilian.
The only complaint however which Erasmus makes against his friend is for
his excessive elaboration in polishing and correcting his writings, from
which it resulted that much of his work was reserved as not sufficiently
perfect to be published: and in many cases ultimately lost[14]. It is
disappointing to hear that Linacre had translated Aristotle in such a way
that Erasmus says ‘_sic Latine legitur Aristoteles ut, licet Atticus, vix
in suo sermone parem habeat gratiam_’: and of his other versions ‘_sunt
illi permulta in scriniis, magno usui futura studiosis_.’

Beside the excellence of his style, Linacre was famed for his critical
judgment, ‘_vir non exacti tantum sed severi judicii_’, says Erasmus,
while in Grammar and Rhetoric, as shewn in the curious little fable of
Richard Pacey formerly quoted, he was regarded as no less a master.
Moreover he was what was called in those days an eminent ‘philosopher,’
that is, profoundly read in the works of the ancient naturalists and
philosophers, such as Aristotle, Plato and Pliny.

It is not easy to form any distinct notion of Linacre’s skill in his own
profession. Little more was expected of a physician in those days than
to apply with proper care the maxims of the books. We do not even know
whether in his practice Linacre made more use of the ancient medical
classics whom he was endeavouring to rescue from neglect than of the
‘Neoterics’ who were the ruling spirits of the day, and whose doctrines
were derived from the Arab physicians or from European schools sprung out
of the Arab learning. Some have taken for granted that a man so great in
book learning could not be good in practice. But the few notices which
remain give no countenance to this assumption. Erasmus commemorates
in two or three places his friend’s medical skill. In one he deplores
Linacre’s absence, and laments (with curious modernism) that his servant
had left the physician’s last prescription at the druggist’s, and begs
for another copy. In one instance a record of Linacre’s treatment of
Erasmus’s complaint remains, and appears to have been as sensible and
practical, as if the physician had known not a word of Greek, and had
passed his life as a country apothecary. He is also recorded to have
advised his friend William Lily not to consent to an operation for the
removal of a tumour of the hip; but the operation undertaken against
Linacre’s advice, unfortunately proved fatal.

It was not Linacre’s fortune to contribute anything to the science of
medicine, or to any of its collateral sciences. His age was not one
of research as now understood. The first original work on medicine
produced in England was done by his successor Caius, whose treatise on
the sweating sickness published twenty years after Linacre’s death is
still esteemed. This and other great epidemics must have passed before
the eyes of Linacre, but no record remains to shew us in what light
he regarded them. Nor is there any evidence that he appreciated the
importance of the revival of Anatomy and Botany; sciences on which the
subsequent development of medicine in Europe has so largely been based.
Though evidently eagerly desirous to assist in the renovation of medical
science, he looked to other means to accomplish this end. What these
means were it may be worth while to state somewhat more in detail.

The aim which Linacre and other scholars set before them in translating
or publishing the works of Galen can only be understood by a
consideration of the state of medical learning and scholarship at the
time. The student of medicine in those days, like the student of theology
or philosophy, had to derive his knowledge almost entirely from books.
There was indeed one school of practical anatomy in Italy, that founded
by Mundinus at Bologna in the 14th century, and continued in Linacre’s
time by Berengarius Carpus, who is said to have dissected one hundred
bodies with his own hand, but in other parts of Europe only a literary
knowledge of anatomy was possible. There was no such thing as hospital
instruction, and what would be called in modern times Materia Medica
was represented only by the empirical knowledge of humble collectors
of simples, and by the works of scholars learned only in books who
gave descriptions borrowed at second or third hand from the Arabian
physicians, or at a still greater distance from Aristotle. Medical
learning, thus understood, received like all other learning the stimulus
of two great movements, the revival of Greek literature, with the
consequent higher estimation of the classical Latin writers, on the one
hand, and on the other hand the readier diffusion of books through the
invention of printing. How the classical revival affected letters in
general, theology and philosophy, is well known. Everywhere men became
aware more or less distinctly that there was a new world of knowledge
within their reach, but concealed from them by a mass of commentary and
compilation, barbarous in language, and corrupt in substance, though
professedly founded on the works of those great authors who were little
more than names to the mediæval scholars. Gradually the great figures
of antiquity became more distinct, as the followers of the new learning
tore off the barbarous wrappings which had so long hidden or distorted
them. It was in this spirit that the scholars set to work in their great
task of restoring antiquity. There were doubtless many other aims, and
some of them higher, which animated the more ardent spirits of the
Renaissance, but of these we cannot pretend to speak. What alone concerns
us here is their resolute endeavour to get at the real Aristotle, Plato
or Homer, instead of the reflections and shadows of them which had long
been reverenced. It was this spirit which made the printing of the
first edition of Homer by Chalcondylas and Demetrius Cretensis in 1488,
seem to them, as it has indeed seemed to later generations, an epoch
in literature. It was this which in the next generation led Erasmus to
devote years of labour to bringing out the Novum Testamentum, and it
was in this spirit too, that Linacre the pupil of Chalcondylas and the
teacher of Erasmus, standing between the literary and the religious
revival, conceived the two great projects of his life, the publication
of Aristotle and Galen in a form accessible to the whole learned world.
The first scheme indeed he scarcely commenced, of the latter he did but
little, though as he says “nihil magis in votis erat.”

To discover the genuine text of an ancient author and make it known
may seem to us a useful task, though not among the greatest, but to
the scholars of the Renaissance it was a matter of supreme importance.
Linacre and his fellow workers doubtless expected that medicine would
profit as much by the rediscovery of the Greek medical writings as
letters and philosophy had gained from the masterpieces of Greek
poetry and speculation; and it was with such hopes that they undertook
to revive and make known the works of Galen. Galen, like Aristotle,
had been very imperfectly known, even to those who most implicitly
acknowledged his authority. With regard to Aristotle Sir Alexander Grant
has pointed out that thousands of scholars who considered themselves
staunch Aristotelians, knew not a word of the master beyond the two first
treatises in the Organon; and in the same way, many who reverenced Galen
as the source of all medical knowledge, knew him only through imperfect
Latin versions, the compilations of mediæval scholars, or of the
Arabians, whose works were chiefly based on Galen, and who had in this
case as in that of Aristotle the credit of making a Greek author in large
measure known to the modern world.

The works of Avicenna, Mesua and others were the chief medical text-books
in Europe before, and even for a long time after, the revival of
learning. The Jewish teachers, who had founded schools of surgery in
many European cities, (among others in Oxford, before the rise of the
University) were versed in Arabian learning, and thus it came to pass
that medicine presented itself to the mediæval world in an Arabian dress.
From these sources and from the teachers of the school of Salerno, were
compiled the manuals of the “Arabistæ” or “Neoterici,” which under such
names as Articella, Practica, Lilium Medicinæ, Rosa Anglica were the
daily guides of the medical practitioner.

When the Arabian writers fell into disrepute, partly through being
condemned as heretical, and partly as being barbarous in style, it was
regarded, if one may say so, as a sort of indignity that Medical Science
should still be so much beholden to the infidel sages. Those physicians
who were also scholars felt this to be a reproach which must be wiped
out. This feeling, fantastic as it may seem, was apparently wide-spread
through the little world of scholars, and has been expressed by one of
them in a manner so strange that I cannot forbear to quote it both for
the sake of the grain of truth which it contains, and for its unconscious
reflection of the fantastic ideas of the age.

The author Symphorien Champier was a physician of Lyons, a voluminous
writer as well as a liberal and wealthy patron of letters. The extract
is from a short tract _Symphonia Galeni ad Hippocratem, Cornelii Celsi
ad Avicennam, una cum sectis antiquorum medicorum ac recentium_, forming
the introduction to a little work on Clysters, _Clysteriorum campi
contra Arabum opinionem pro Galeni sententiâ_, etc., which is known in
literature as the original of the “Treatise on Clysters, by S. C.”,
placed by Rabelais in the catalogue of books forming the library of St
Victor.

After lamenting that for so many centuries pure literature, that is
Greek and Roman, should have been neglected, and instead the mean ditties
(_neniæ_) of certain pretenders should have been cultivated. _Indignum
facinus_, says Champier, _(ita me deus amet) nullis bobus, nullisque
victimis expiandum_.

Next, passing to the subjects of philosophy and medicine, he represents
a war as arising between the Arabians and the Classics, which might have
ended disastrously for the latter, but for the interposition of divine
providence.

“Jam eo insolentiæ ac temeritatis devenerant Arabi principes, ut nobis
medicam artem funditus auferre audacissime conarentur; quandoquidem
castra solventes in Græcos ac Latinos omnem belli impetum convertebant,
multaque millia processerant, cum deus Opt. Max. (cujus est hominum
repente et consilia et animos immutare) ut auguror sanctissimi Lucæ
precibus et orationibus flexus, auxiliarios milites demisit, qui
obsidione miseros, Hippocratem, Galenum, Dioscoridem, Paulum Aeginetam
et nostrum Celsum Cornelium, jam deditionem cogitantes eriperent et
liberarent; idque quantâ sit confectum diligentiâ, in confesso est.
Hippocrati non pauci auxilio fuere, Galeno ab Arabum principe oppresso
strennue [sic] adfuit Vicentinorum dux [Nicolaus Leonicenus], præterea ex
Galliâ Copus, ex Angliâ Linacrus, bone deus quo studio, quâ alacritate.
Porro Dioscoridi Gallorum virtus et ferocia, Venetorum prudentia,
Florentinorum divitiæ opem tulerunt.”

This passage only puts in an extravagant form the same ideas about the
value of ancient learning in relation to medicine which we have already
quoted from the letters of Leonicenus, and of Aldus.

A more serious scholar than Symphorien Champier, Janus Cornarius, has
left a very clear statement of the position which Galen and the ancient
medical writers were considered to occupy at this critical epoch in the
history of learning.

He says that medicine, like all good arts and disciplines, comes from
the Greeks, and is to be learnt from their works alone. As to the Arabs,
Avicenna, Rhazes and others, who now-a-days reign in nearly all our
schools, and the numerous Italian or French physicians, who have become
celebrated by writing so many of the books called ‘_Practica_,’ they
are physicians only in name. It were to be wished, he says, that all
public schools would acknowledge their errors and repudiate the barbarian
physicians, as the Florentine academy had done.

“At vero non penitus desperandum quando nuper adeo una Florentina
Academia resipiscendo aliquando etiam aliis spem nobis exhibuit, quæ
excusso Arabicæ et barbaræ servitutis medicæ jugo, ex professo se
Galenicam appellavit et profligato barbarorum exercitû, unum totum et
solum Galenum, ut optimum artis medicæ authorem, in omnibus se sequuturum
pollicita est[15].”

The above extracts will shew far more vividly than any generalized
statements in what light Galen and the ancients appeared to scholars
at the time of the revival of learning. Before considering what was
the actual effect of the revival of the ancient medicine on modern
science and practice, it may be well to clear away a certain amount of
misconception which has been prevalent on the subject.

It is often assumed that the study of Galen introduced the habit of
relying implicitly on authority and dogma, and thus retarded the progress
of medicine. But in reality the habits of submission to authority and
blind acceptance of tradition were already prevalent, and had been so
long before the revival of learning. Never were men more ready to bow
down to authority than in the middle ages; and, in name at least, they
reverenced even the ancient rulers of thought, Aristotle, Galen and
Hippocrates, though it was to distorted images of these heroic personages
that their homage was paid. The names of Galen and Hippocrates were
associated with corrupt and often spurious treatises, of which the
style was as barbarous as the matter was worthless. The aphorisms of
Hippocrates were known in Latin versions as the _Amphorismi_, a barbarism
perpetuated even by Symphorien Champier. Galen was chiefly known by a
little treatise, often copied and printed with the title _Liber Tegni
Galieni_, afterwards known as the _Ars Parva_ to distinguish it from the
great _Methodus Medendi_, translated by Linacre. The quaint title of
this work is a history and a commentary in itself; a scholar might well
be puzzled with the word _Tegni_, which seems to suggest an imaginary
author, Tegnus Galienus. But this word is simply a corruption of the
Greek τέχνη, handed down by a succession of scribes ignorant of Greek.
Moreover, as in the case of Aristotle, not only were the works ascribed
to Galen and Hippocrates corrupted and misunderstood; but their best
works were unknown. If men were to bow down to canonical authority it
was better they should have the best works of the writers regarded as
canonical, and have them unadulterated.

On the lowest view then the change was rather the substitution of one
dogma for another than the introduction of the dogmatic habit; but in
reality a much wider and more salutary reform was involved. In the first
place, the new authorities were actually much more valuable than the
old, and in the second place the new dogma, instead of being merely
conservative and petrifying, was found to be innovating and inspiriting
in its tendency. Galen himself was not so strictly a Galenist as his
followers. His works shew (in spite of his undeniable and fatal love of
system and formula) enterprise and originality, with frequent reference
to observation, and even experiment. They led also inevitably to a study
of Hippocrates, a writer far more unsystematic, and free from the vice
of formalism, whose sagacity and power of observation give his works a
perennial freshness. Finally, the revival of the ancient classics led
to the revival also of the sciences on which modern medicine rests, and
which were destined to overthrow all the dogmatic systems, viz. Anatomy
and the knowledge of Drugs.

Haller, speaking of the progress of anatomy in the 16th century,
attributes it to two chief causes, the revival of the works of Galen, and
the invention of printing. Not less did Botany and Pharmacology take a
new departure from the works of Dioscorides. It would thus appear that
the task of Linacre and the scholars, really though not in appearance,
contributed to the scientific movement which was the turning-point in
modern medicine. This movement was the special work of the 16th century.
The time had not yet come for the reform in practical medicine which
the progress of the sciences rendered possible, and which was reserved
to be the special glory of the next age. But a definite and brilliant
service was rendered to the progress of medicine by the scholars of the
Renaissance, among whom no name is better entitled to be held in grateful
remembrance than that of Thomas Linacre.

It would be out of place here to enter into any general estimate of the
value of Galen’s writings. They are of immense bulk, and few persons
in modern times can claim to have done more than dip into them. But
this massiveness and bulk were perhaps even among the features which
caused his works to be held in such high estimation. They formed a vast
encyclopædia in which all the ancient medical lore was comprised. A very
large part of the works even of Hippocrates may be said to be contained
in Galen, and many older writers are now only known through the account
which Galen has given of them. The Galenical collection embraces anatomy,
physiology, practical medicine, and what we should now call Hygiene, as
well as dissertations on the history and sects of medicine, with many
curious anecdotes and allusions to the manners and opinions of his time.
We hear also of works on logic and philosophy which are almost entirely
lost.

This encyclopædic knowledge was classified with a systematic minuteness
and a delusive appearance of scientific precision which especially fitted
Galen to be a ruler of thought in ages when men were willing to accept an
intellectual despotism. The disciple of Galen had a formula to explain
every disease, and a rule for the treatment of every case.

What his general principles were is shewn very clearly in the work now
reprinted, which is rather physiological or physical than strictly
medical. In it we find developed the theory of humours and temperaments,
which formed the physiological basis of Galen’s system of medicine;
and which, conveyed through many popular medical works to the lay
public, entered largely into the current philosophy of the time. Hence
Linacre speaks of this work as not less necessary to philosophers than
to physicians. Some knowledge of these ideas is indispensable for
understanding many allusions and metaphors in English writers of the
Elizabethan age. Nay more, a great part of it has passed into our common
language. Such words as ‘_humour_’ in its many acceptations, and many
compounds, _temperament_, _temper_, _choler_, _melancholy_ and others
derived all their original significance from the place which they held
in the Galenical system. It is perhaps not too much to suppose that this
very version may have been among the sources whence such writers as
Elyot (who was a pupil of Linacre) in his _Castell of Helth_, Bright,
the predecessor of Burton, in his _Treatise of Melancholie_, and later,
Walkington, in the fantastic book called _The Optick Glasse of Humors_,
obtained the ideas which, popularized by them, became the common property
of scholars and literary men. From this point of view, our treatise is
not without importance in the history of English literature.

The little treatise at the end, _De Inæquali intemperie_, is no part of
the work which precedes it; but is apparently appended by Linacre to shew
Galen’s application of his physiological system to certain points in
pathology or the theory of disease.

It is only necessary to say in conclusion that this version of the
_De Temperamentis_ appears to have been the first ever made in Latin,
or at least published. Orlandi (in 1722) speaks of a previous edition
with Linacre’s name, published at Venice in the year 1498, but this
statement is certainly erroneous. All the enquiries of Linacre’s learned
biographer, Dr Noble Johnson, and of the present editor, have failed to
establish the existence of any such edition, and indeed the preface to
this edition is of itself enough to refute the story. The treatise _De
inæquali intemperie_ on the other hand had been previously translated
into Latin, though not by Linacre. It is included in a collection of
Latin versions of many of the works of Galen and others, translated
by Georgius Valla, of Piacenza. This was printed at Venice in 1498;
and hence, no doubt, the source of the confusion between Valla’s
translation of this treatise and Linacre’s translation of this and the
_De Temperamentis_. I have seen the third edition of Valla’s collection
published at Pavia 1516; the version of this treatise there given is
quite different from Linacre’s. Dr Johnson is responsible for the
statement that a second edition of both was published during Linacre’s
lifetime, of which a presentation copy on vellum given to Henry VIII. is
in the Bodleian Library. But an examination of this copy has convinced
me that it is of the same edition, though an error in the printing of
the last six leaves makes it appear different. According to the British
Museum Catalogue a second edition in 24mo. was printed at London in 1527.
The version was frequently reprinted on the continent, either alone
or as a part of the collected Latin editions of Galen’s works; but no
subsequent edition has appeared in this country.

SOURCES OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF LINACRE.

The only separate biography of Linacre is that by Dr Noble Johnson,
a fellow of the College of Physicians, published, in 1835 after the
author’s death, under the editorship of Mr Robert Graves. From this
the biographical part of the short sketch here given has been chiefly
derived. Dr Johnson collected with great learning and industry the
contemporary notices of Linacre, as well as all that has appeared in
later writers, and investigated many manuscript authorities. It would be
ungrateful here to point out the few errors into which he has fallen,
especially as they are probably partly due to his work having been
published without the author’s personal revision. The earliest life is
either that contained in the Elogia contributed by George Lily to the
_Descriptio Britanniæ_ of Paulus Jovius, Venetiis, 1548 (also Basileæ
1578), or that given in Bale’s _Illustrium majoris Britanniæ scriptorum
summarium_. Gippeswici, 1548. Further materials are contained in Leland
(_Principum … et eruditorum etc. encomia._ London 1589) Pits (_De
Illustribus Angliæ scriptoribus_); Freind’s _History of Physic_; the
_Biographia Britannica_; Wood’s _Athenæ Oxonienses_, Bishop Tanner’s
_Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica_, etc. Later biographical collections,
such as Aitken’s _Biographical Memoirs of Medicine_, the _Lives of the
British Physicians_, and Dr Munk’s learned _Roll of the Royal College
of Physicians_, have added little or nothing. The present Editor has
carefully verified most of Dr Johnson’s references; and corrected or
added a few facts, but has found little to glean after so exhaustive a
worker. The latter part, however, of this short introduction owes little
to Dr Johnson. I have to thank Mr Bradshaw, the University Librarian, for
some valuable hints.

finds fault with Cheke for too Ciceronian a style of writing (Ciceronis

Cicero and could not listen to it without disgust. Cheke retorts in the
manner we have quoted, “Si de acumine et celeritate ingenii disputatur
etc.—in eo si nunc viveret, tibi laudem concederet,” and makes the
curious remark that it is strange Linacre could not listen to Cicero
without disgust, when his work _De structurâ_ abounds with examples taken
from Cicero. Perhaps, Cheke suggests, he had not really neglected the
study of that writer, but through some perversity wished to be thought to
have neglected him, “ut non tam fortasse reverâ neglexerit, quam animi
quâdam morositate videri voluit neglexisse.”

GALENI PERGAMENSIS De temperamentis, Liber primus. Thoma Linacro Anglo
interprete.


Constare animalium corpora ex calidi, frigidi, sicci, humidique mixtura,
nec esse horum omnium parem in temperatura portionem, demonstratum
antiquis abunde est, tum philosophorum, tum medicorum praecipuis. Diximus
autem & nos de iis, ea quae probabilia sunt uisa alio opere. In quo de
iis, quae Hyppocrates constituit elementis, egimus. Hoc opere, quod
illi proxime succedit, omnium temperamentorum differentias, quot hae,
qualesque sint, siue generatim quis, siue membratim diuidat, inuenire
docebo. Sumamque ab ipsa nominum interpretatione principium. Cum nanque
ex calidi, frigidi, sicci, & humidi, temperatura conflari corpora dicunt,
de iis, quae summo gradu sic se habent, ipsis scilicet elementis, aëre,
igni, aqua, terra, intelligendum aiunt. Cum uero animal, stirpemue
calidam, humidam, frigidam, uel siccam esse, non item. Neque enim ullum
animal, aut calidum in summo esse posse, ut est ignis, aut in summo
humidum, sicut est aqua: pari modo nec frigidum, siccumue in summo.
Sed ab eo quod in mixtura pollet, appellationem sortiri, uocantibus
nobis id humidum, in quo maior est humiditatis portio, siccum, in quo
siccitatis. Ita uero & calidum, in quo calidum frigido plus ualet,
frigidum uero in quo frigidum calido praestat. Atque hic quidem nominum
usus est. Nunc de temperamentis ipsis agendum. Eorum igitur, qui tum
medicorum, tum philosophorum maxime illustres fuere, plurimi sane opinati
sunt humidum aliquod calidumque temperamentum ab humido & frigido
diuersum esse. Ac tertium ab hiis siccum & frigidum, diuersum a sicco
& calido. Nonnulli tamen eorum humidum simul ac frigidum temperamentum
quoddam esse concedunt, atque etiam ab hoc alterum calidum siccumque.
Non tamen aut humidum simul & calidum, aut frigidum pariter & siccum
temperamentum esse. Neque enim posse aut humiditatem cum abundante
calore, consistere, aut cum frigiditate siccitatem: quippe absumi a
calido, cum superat, humiditatem. Itaque fieri, ut calidum simul & siccum
corpus euadat, Eandem ubi imbecillus in corpore calor est, incoctam,
imperfectamque manere, quo fieri, ut calido uincente, sequatur siccitas,
frigido superante, humiditas. Atque hii quidem his rationibus nixi, duas
tantum esse temperamentorum differentias opinantur. Qui uero ea quatuor
autumant, bifariam his contradicunt. Alii statim id quod primum petunt
negantes, nempe quod necesse sit humorem a calido superante digeri.
Alii contra id quidem assentiuntur, sed alia ratione dissentiunt. Ac
priores quidem calidi munus esse, ut calefaciat, asseuerant, frigidi
ut refrigeret, sicuti rursus sicci, ut siccet, & humidi, ut humectet.
Proinde corpora, quae calida siccaque natura sint, quemadmodum ignis,
ea quatenus calida sunt, excalfacere, quatenus sicca siccare. Quae
humida calidaque sunt, uelut calens aqua, haec non humectare modo, sed
etiam calefacere posse, utraque qualitate hic quoque unum opus, idque
proprium obtinente. Haudquaquam igitur concedere se, si quid calefaciat,
idem protinus & siccare, immo si calori humiditas sit adiuncta, non
calfacere modo, sed etiam humectare. Quemadmodum balneum dulcis aquae.
Sin sicuti calidum, ita etiam siccum corpus sit, ueluti ignis, statim
id tum calfacere, tum uero siccare. Non tamen id calori referendum
acceptum, sed siccitati, quae simul est coniuncta. Admonent autem hoc
loco nos de his, qui sub estiuo sole diutius sunt uersati, atque ita, ut
credibile est arefacti, ac totum corpus siccum, squallidumque habent,
intolerabiliterque sitiunt. Quippe remedium his expeditum, & facile
dicunt, non utique si biberint, sed si calidae, & dulcis aquae balneo
utantur, tanquam humiditate, siue ea cum frigore sit, siue cum calore,
suum munus obire ualente. Quippe humectare ea quae contingat. Ad eundem
modum & siccitatem semper aiunt siccare, boream enim qui siccus &
frigidus sit uentus, omnia siccare ac refrigerare, idque esse dictum ab
Homero, ut uero humentem desiccat protinus agrum autumni boreas. Pari
modo & papaueris lachrymam, & alia sexcenta pharmaca siccare pariter
& refrigerare. Itaque non esse necessarium, siquid frigidum est, idem
protinus & humidum esse. Nec siquid calidum, idem statim & siccum. Neque
igitur calidum temperamentum necessario esse siccum, immo posse aliquando
in animalis temperamento calidum quidem plus ualere, quam frigidum, &
humidum, quam siccum. Quin etiam tum generationem, tum alterationem,
tum mutationem, ex contrariis in contraria fieri. Quis enim est, qui
si dixerit album alteratum, demutatumque esse, propterea quod factum
sit calidum, non sit ridiculus? Cum postulet ea oratio, non eam, quae
est in calido & frigido, sed quae est in colore, oppositionem. Mutatur
enim quod album est, in nigrum, & quod nigrum est, in album. Rursus quod
calidum est, in frigidum, & quod frigidum est, in calidum. Ad eundem
modum, & quod humidum est, in siccum, & quod siccum est, in humidum.
Quippe si dicas alteratum corpus esse, propterea quod cum prius esset
humidum, nunc sit album, uel cum prius esset siccum, nunc sit nigrum,
parum compos mentis uidearis. Sin quod prius erat humidum, nunc factum
esse siccum, aut quod prius erat nigrum, nunc effectum album, aut etiam
ex calido frigidum, aut ex frigido calidum, utique sapere & conuenientia
dicere censearis. Quod enim mutatur, quatenus mutatur, eatenus cedere
in contrarium debet. Siquidem fiebat hic, aut fit musicus, ex non
musico dicimus: & grammaticus, ex non grammatico: & rhetor, ex non
rhetore. Ex musico uero grammaticum, aut ex grammatico musicum, aut ex
alio quod diuersi sit generis, fieri aliquid dicere, sane est absurdum.
Potest enim qui prius erat grammaticus, nunc musicus esse, utique si
musicen grammaticae adiecit, nec grammaticam abiecit. At qui siquid
acquisiuit, priore etiam manente, cui non patet, non esse alteratum in
eo quod manet? Ita non ex grammatico factus est musicus. Quippe nunc
etiam grammaticus est, sed ex non musico, musicus. Non enim potest
postquam musicus est factus, etiam non musicus manere. Cum igitur omnis
mutatio, & ab contrariis, & ex contrariis fiat in contraria, manifestum
est etiam humidum si quatenus humidum est, mutetur, tum ipsum siccatum
iri, tum quod id siccet, siccum dicendum esse. Desinant igitur inquiunt
dicere, non posse calidum, & humidum temperamentum esse. Quippe calidum
simul & frigidum esse idem temperamentum, aut humidum, & siccum non
potest. Cum fieri nequeat, ut in eodem corpore contrariae qualitates
una consistant: humidum uero simul & calidum, praeterea frigidum simul
ac siccum, profecto in eodem consistere possunt: sicuti tum ratio ipsa
monstrauit, tum quae paulo supra proposita sunt exempla. Ac talis quidem
est prioris propositarum partium oratio. Altera pars negat alienum a
ratione esse, etiam si calidum efficacissimum e quatuor sit, ita ut
non in frigidum modo, sed etiam in humidum agere possit: esse tamen
temperamentum, quod calidum sit, & humidum, utique cum in primo statim
animantis ortu humoris simul, calorisque copia in idem coeant. Ratio
uero horum non illud efficit, quod nequeat aliquando in eodem corpore
humidi plus esse, quam sicci, & calidi, quam frigidi. Sed quod sub
eiusmodi statu durare perpetuo non possit. Quippe digesto semper per
calidum humore, spatio etiam siccum corpus effici. Atque pro calido &
humido, calidum siccumque reddi. Iam hoc ipsum quod calidum & siccum
est redditum, procedente tempore frigidum siccumque fore: ubi enim
omnem eiusmodi corporis humorem calor absumpsit, ipse quoque (inquiunt)
marcescere incipit, destitutus scilicet alimento, quod ipsum accenderat.
Neque igitur mirum putant tum inter initia, statim ut gignitur animal
conuenire in idem, aut humidum plus sicco, aut calidum plus frigido,
tum temporis processu, quod prius erat calidum & humidum, postea posse
calidum esse & siccum, aeque ut postea quae sicca erat, calidaque
temperies, ubi calor ipse extinctus est, frigidam siccamque euadere.
Ergo esse quidem aliquod temperamentum, quod calidum sit & humidum, ac
rursus aliud quod frigidum sit & siccum, ex istis confirmant: Non posse
autem temperamentorum differentias plures esse, quam quatuor, ex his
docere conantur. Cum enim quatuor statuuntur qualitates, quae in se
agere inuicem patique possint. Nempe calor, frigus, siccitas, humiditas,
oppositiones existere duas, alteram in qua calidum aduersatur frigido,
alteram in qua humidum pugnat cum sicco. Eoque quatuor non amplius
effici coniugationes. Quippe sex fieri, ex quatuor inter se copulatis,
coniugia. Quorum duo subsistere non posse. Cum neque humidum pariter &
siccum, nec calidum simul & frigidum dari corpus possit. Reliquas igitur
esse quatuor temperamentorum coniugationes, duas humidas, & duas siccas.
Atque has calore, frigoreque diuisas, haec sunt quae elegantissimi
eorum, qui ante nos fuere, tum medicorum, tum philosophorum de his
dixere. Quae uero mihi praetermisisse uidentur, nunc adiiciendum reor,
unum igitur & primum id est, quod temperatam naturam, quae tamen non
uirtute modo, sed etiam uiribus reliquis praestat, non aduerterunt.
Immo tanquam nulla sit, prorsus omiserunt. Quanquam ne loqui quidem de
reliquis aliquid sine hac potuerunt. Quippe quod uel in calida temperie
calidum praeualeat frigido, uel in frigida temperie, frigidum praestet
calido, id ne intellexisse quidem est, nisi prius ponatur eucratos siue
temperata, neque enim alio quam ad hanc temperatam naturam sunt intenti
cum sanitatis tuendae uictum inuestigant, calidius iusto corpus iubentes
refrigerare, uel frigidius excalfacere, uel rursus humidius siccare,
uel siccius humectare. Scilicet quo temperatum quendam mediocremque
statum efficiant, id quod minus est ei, quod exuperat semper aequantes.
Ergo quem assidue sectantur, & quo semper respicientes intemperatos
status corrigunt, hunc ego quidem primum omnium statui censuerim. Hi
uero tantum abest, ut eius uel meminerint, ut etiam totum praetereant.
At non praeterimus inquiunt ex his aliqui. In calido enim & humido
comprehenditur. Et quomodo non quinque esse in totum temperamenta
dixistis: sed quatuor, si modo optimum non omisistis? Quippe duorum
alterum, aut ex intemperatis statibus necesse est unum esse omissum, aut
ipsum temperatum. Atque ego quidem ex his, quae statuunt, temperatum
ipsis praetermissum certo scio: ubi enim calidum & siccum, uel frigidum
& humidum, uel aliud quoduis temperamentum nominant, non utique summas a
nobis intelligi qualitates postulant. Immo ex iis, quae superant fieri
appellationes uolunt. Quod si temperatum statum omitti nolunt, certe
reliquorum aliquem omisisse conuincentur. Sit enim sicut ipsi uolunt,
temperatus status, is qui calidus est, & humidus. Omissus igitur illis
plane est, is qui frigido intemperamento aduersetur, & sicco. Nempe in
quo humidum pollet & calidum. At idem inquiunt is est. At qui fieri
potest, ut simul exuperet calidum, & non exuperet? & superetur frigidum,
& non superetur? Si enim temperatus status est, neutrum alterum immodice
exuperat. Sin intemperatus, necesse est exuperet altera oppositionum pars.
At hoc ipsum inquiunt temperati status proprium est, ut in eo calidum
praestet frigido, & humidum sicco. Quippe si frigidum modice quidem
uincat, non esse commodum temperamentum. Sin amplius exuperet, iam utique
morbum existere: aeque ut si uehementer exuperet, mortem. Ad eundem
modum de sicco iudicandum. In principio quidem existere intemperiem. Si
amplius augeatur, aegritudinem, si plurimum exuperet, mortem. Ceu uero
de calido & humido non idem sit iudicium. Quis enim non dicat, ubi uel
calidum frigido, uel humidum sicco paulo quidem plus ualet, intemperiem
ita fieri, ubi ampliter exuperat, morbum, ubi plurimum, mortem? Si quidem
eadem est utrobique ratio. Alioqui nec qui calidi humidique immodice
status sunt, eos uitio demus: nec qui calidi morbi cum humore immodico
consistunt, eos esse morbos fateamur. Huic sententiae aduersantes quidam
Attalensis Athenei sectatores, negant aut calidum humidumque statum uitio
dandum, aut morbum ullum inueniri, qui calidus sit & humidus. Sed omnino
qui uel calidus sit & siccus, ut febris, uel frigidus & humidus, ut aqua
intercus, uel frigidus & siccus, ut melancolia. Faciunt hic & de anni
temporibus mentionem. Quorum hiemem frigidam esse atque humidam dicunt.
Estatem calidam & siccam. Autumnum frigidum & siccum. Ver autem tum
temperatum, tum uero calidum humidumque appellant. Ad eundem modum, & ex
aetatibus puerilem quidem temperatam esse, tum uero calidam humidamque:
porro indicare autumant eorum temperiem ex naturalibus actionibus, quae
illa aetate maxime sint firmae. Sed & mortem aiunt animantium corpora
ad frigidum siccumque perducere, Quippe mortuos Graece ἀλίβαντας,
uocari, quasi nihil humecti in se habentes. Vtpote tum caloris abitione
eo exhaustos tum frigore rigentes. Quod si, inquiunt, mors talis est
naturae, certe uita, cum sit illi contraria, calida est & humida.
At uero si uita calidum quiddam atque humidum est, omnino quod illi
simillimum temperamentum est, id optimum necessario est. Quod si est,
neminem latere, idem quoque temperatissimum esse. Sic in idem recidere
calidum humidumque statum, cum temperato, nec aliud esse temperatum, siue
eucraton statum, quam caliditatem simul & humiditatem pollentes. Atque
Athenei quidem sequatium hae sunt rationes, uideturque & Aristotelis
philosophi, & post eum Theophrasti, & Stoicorum eadem esse quodamodo
sententia. Ita testium quoque numero nos territant. Ego uero quemadmodum
Aristoteles de calida humidaque temperie senserit, in progressu si res
postulet, fortasse explicabo, uidentur enim eum non recte accipere. Nunc
id agam, ut eos qui sic sentiunt, in quo seipsos fallant, doceam. Mox
rem totam in unum coactam caput demonstrem. Cum enim calidum, & humidum,
atque etiam eucraton existimant uer esse, hic se manifeste decipiunt. Nam
neque humidum est sicut hiems, neque calidum sicut aestas, quare neutrum
immodice. Cum tamen ipsis autoribus excessum quendam indicet quoduis
talium nominum. Bifariam autem sunt decepti, primum quidem quod in
quatuor anni temporibus, quartam temperamentorum coniugationem inuentam
omnino uolunt. Deinde quod id ea ratione concludunt, quod sit hieme
quidem calidius, aestate uero humidius, uerum nec quartam in temporibus
anni statuere temperamenti coniugationem est necesse, nisi etiam talis
appareret, & contulisse id cum temporibus vtrinque positis, non magis
id humidum & calidum, quam frigidum probat & siccum. Si enim calidum
humidumque excessus cuiusdam nomina sunt, non potest, nec ipsis quidem
autoribus, uerum esse quod uer in omnibus mediocre sit. Si autem eo quod
aestate humidius est, hieme uero calidius, idcirco humidum est & calidum.
Quid causae est, quo minus frigidum id siccumque putes, propterea quod
aestate est frigidius, & hieme siccius? uel quam sibi facit sortitionem,
ut unam parte oppositionis ab hieme, alteram ab aestate accipiat. Quippe
cum ab utroque in utraque oppositionum parte dissideat, non ex dimidio
collationem, sed ex toto habere debebat. Atqui si ita fiat contraria
illi inesse dicemus. Nam calidum erit & siccum, si conferatur cum hieme,
frigidum & humidum, si cum aestate. Ex neutra igitur collatione, si
modo integra est, calidum & humidum erit. Sed si illis licet ex utraque
oppositione sumpto dimidio, calidum id humidumque asserere, nobis quoque
ad alterum dimidium transire, atque id frigidum & siccum dicere, quidni
licebit. Scilicet siccum, ut ad hiemem, frigidum, ut ad aestatem. Omnia
igitur hac ratione uer erit, humidum, siccum, calidum frigidum. Atqui
illorum ipsorum sententia, non possunt quatuor qualitates in vna eademque
re pollere. Ergo neque aestati, neque hiemi uer comparare est aequum.
Sed potius ipsum per se estimare. Neque enim hiemem ipsam ea de causa
humidam esse, & frigidam dicimus, quod reliquis temporibus humidior
frigidiorque sit. Immo id illi alia quoque ratione accidit. Sed quod
humiditas in ea superet siccitatem, & frigiditas calorem, propterea
frigida dicitur, atque humida. Ad eundem modum & aestas, quum in ea
humor uincitur a sicco, & frigidum a calido, ipsa quoque calida dicitur
& sicca. Siquidem aequum censeo quatuor anni temporum quodlibet ex
suapte estimatum natura, non ex alterius comparatione calidum, frigidum,
humidum, siccum ue nominari debere. Quin etiam si ad hanc formulam
estimes, apparebit tibi uer esse omnis excessus plane in medio. Cum neque
sicut in hieme plus ualeat in eo frigidum quam calidum. neque sicut in
aestate, minus. Ad eundem modum siccitatis humiditatisque aequabilitatem
in eo spectes. Neque scilicet in eo sicut in aestate praeualente sicco,
neque sicut in hieme, exuperante humido. Proinde recte ab Hyppocrate est
dictum: uer esse saluberrimum, ac minime morbis, qui mortem afferant,
obnoxium. Est & autumnus ut quam aestas minus calidus, sic utique quam
hiems minus frigidus. Quare hac ratione nec calidus absoluto sermone
est, nec frigidus. Quippe cum ambo sit, ac neutrum ad summum. Caeterum
alterum in eo est incommodum. Quod etiam Hyppocratis illa sententia
significauit: Cum eodem die modo frigus nos afficit, modo calor urget,
autumnales expectandi morbi sunt. Atque ea res est, quae maxime autumnum
morbiferum facit, inequalis ipsa temperies. Itaque non recte frigidus,
siccusque dicitur. Non enim frigidus est, si ipse per se spectetur, quod
tamen hiems est. Sed ubi cum aestate confertur, utique illa frigidior:
sed nec aequabiliter temperatus, sicut uer. Immo in hoc maxime ab illo
tempore dissidet, quod mediam temperiem & equalitatem perpetuo parem non
seruat. Quippe meridie multo est calidior, quam mane aut uesperi. Nec in
humido & sicco medium omnino statum optinet, quemadmodum & uer. Sed ad
siccius deuergit. Ab aestate uero etiam in hoc uincitur. Non tamen tanto
interuallo, quanto in calore. Ergo patere arbitror, nec autumnum absoluto
sermone, & citra exceptionem frigidum & siccum, sicut illis placet,
dicendum esse. Cum neutrum ad summum sit, sed uincat in eo siccitas
humiditatem. Quare ratione merito siccus appelletur. In calore uero &
frigore, mixtum quiddam ex ambobus, & inequale statuatur. Proinde si
quatuor temperamentorum coniugationes in quatuor anni tempora distribui
uolunt, sciant se non solum ueri, calidum, humidumque statum male
assignasse, sed etiam autumno frigidum & siccum. Quanquam si hunc quoque
concedamus frigidum & siccum esse, non erit statim necesse uer humidum
calidumque esse. Non enim si quatuor intemperature coniugationes in totum
sunt, iam omnes eas in quatuor anni tempora dispensari necessum est. Sed
si quis hoc in mundo est ordo, ac prout melius est, non prout peius omnia
sunt disposita, probabilius sit plura quidem ex anni temporibus temperata
esse facta, unum uero, si modo aliquod, intemperatum, hi uero contra
ostendere conantur, nullum eorum esse temperatum. Sed necessario in
ipsis exuperare alias calidum, alias frigidum. Et nunc si ita fors tulit,
siccum, nunc humidum. Ego uero tantum abest, ut aut uer, aut si quid
temperatum est calidum atque humidum dicam, ut quod plane contrarium est,
id affirmem, omnium aeris temperamentorum pessimum id esse, quod humidum
est & calidum. Quod sane temperamentum, in quatuor anni temporibus
inuenire nequeas. In graui & pestilenti aeris statu, interdum incidit,
ueluti quodam loco Hyppocrates commemorat his uerbis: pluebat per aestum
imber largus assidue. Id nanque est humidi & calidi status proprium,
ut in aestu assidue pluat. Quod si uel tantum aestus sit, quemadmodum
in naturaliter se habente aestate, uel pluat. Sed in frigore, ueluti
hieme solet, fieri nequit, ut is status calidus sit & humidus. An igitur
sine morbis erat aestas illa, in qua pluisse dicit in caloribus assidue
largum imbrem? Atqui carbunculos in ea fuisse narrat, putrescentibus
scilicet in corpore excrementis, ac saniem quandam, quae calida humidaque
immodice fuerat gignentibus. Intelliges id ex ipsa dictione, si totam
tibi ascripsero ea sic habet: Erant in cranone carbunculi estiui, pluerat
per estum largo imbri, idque assidue. Acciderant autem magis austro.
Ac suberat quidem sub cute sanies, quae conclusa incaluit, ac pruritum
excitauit. mox pusule ueluti ambustis sunt obortae, urique sub cute
sunt uisae: uerum hic minus utpote uno tantum e quatuor temporibus
mutato, malum fuit. Quod si duo, tria ue sint mutata, aut etiam totus
annus calidus, humidusque fuerit, necesse est, magna pestilentia
succedat. Cuiusmodi in tertio epidemion, id est, grassantium publice
morborum narrat. Apponam autem primum, quae de temporum intempestiuo
statu scripsit: deinde de hominum, quae subsecuta est corruptela.
Aduertas autem animum in omnibus uelim, estimesque primum cuiusmodi
res sit calida, humidaque temperies, quanque ueri quae temperata res
est dissimile: deinde quam necessario in ea omnia putrescant. Incipit
igitur Hyppocratis narratio in hunc modum: Annus Austrinus pluuius a
uentis in totum silens, deinde totius status particularem rationem
subiicit, crebros imbres in calido & austrino statu fuisse scribens. Mox
uniuersum sermonem in unam summam conferens. Cum fuisset, inquit, totus
annus austrinus humidus, & mollis, haec & haec inciderunt, quae utique
omnia in hoc libro scripsisse sit longum, licet autem cui libuerit in
tertio epidemion membratim ea legere, ac in unum caput omnia redacta
uidere: nempe putredinem maximam. Cuius etiam ipsius Hyppocrates non
raro nominatim meminit. Alias sic scribens: Erat autem & fluxio ipsa
collecta, haud similis puri. Sed alia quaedam putredo ac fluxio multa
uariaque. Alias sic: Et in pudendis carbunculi aestiui, tum alia quae
putredines appellantur. Et quod ex hac putredine multis quidem brachium,
& cubitus totus deciderit: multis femur uel sura est nudata, totusque
pes. Quin etiam magni ossium carnium, neruorum, articulorumque prolapsus
inciderunt. Denique nullum ex affectibus, quos scripsit, inuenias, qui
soboles putredinis non sit. Quippe cum nec a sicco putrefieri quicquam
sit aptum, nec a frigido. Intelligas id si carnes & reliqua quaecunque
asseruari ab hominibus solent, obserues haec sale, haec muria, haec
aceto, haec alio quopiam ex iis, quae siccant, commode praeparari.
Deprehendas & Borea, qui siccus natura & frigidus uentus est, omnia quam
diutissime imputria durare. Contra putrescere facillime Austrino statu.
Est enim is uentus calidus & humidus. Adeo nos totum contra, quam hi,
qui calidum & humidum uer autumant decernimus. Cum neque tale sit, neque
si esset, utique salubre esset, aut sanitati accommodum: hi autem & tale
esse uolunt, & propterea etiam salutiferum scilicet utrobique peccantes,
tum in hiis quae sensu percipere tum quae ratione est intelligere. Cum
sensu id manifeste liceat plane temperatum aduertere. Nec minus ratione
illud inuenire, quod propterea est aptum sanitati, quod e quatuor nulla
in eo qualitatum exuperet. Quod si uel caliditas eius frigiditatem
multo excederet, uel humiditas siccitatem, ut uariis putredinibus
obnoxium. Sic omnium anni temporum morbis esset maxime oportunum. Nunc
quatuor qualitatum mixtionis aequalitas, & mediae temperaturae eius, &
salubritatis sunt causae. Quid igitur medicis, ac philosophis quibusdam
persuasit, ut calidum humidumque uer esse iudicarent? Nempe quod quatuor
temperamentorum coniugia quatuor anni temporibus adaptare uoluerunt.
Porro id inde accidit, quod primum omnium temperamentorum, id est,
medium ipsum praetermiserunt. Quin etiam uictuum, medicamentorum, omnium
denique rerum differentias, in has quatuor coniugationes reducunt, ex
quo manifestum est, quantopere parum rectae, fallacesque de hominis
natura rationes, medicationibus obsint. Satiusque erat duorum alterum,
aut prorsus eiusmodi rationes non attigisse: sed totum experientiae
concedere, aut prius in logica speculatione exercitatum fuisse. Quippe
qui nec experientiae est attentus, & naturalia theoremata aggreditur,
priusque rationem, qua haec inueniat conuenienter exercuit, necesse
est in eiusmodi cauilla sit perductus, ac de euidentibus, ceu is, qui
sensu careat, disputet. Tum Aristotelem testem aduocet, male scilicet
accipiendo ea quae praecipit. Hic enim calidum, frigidum, humidum, &
siccum, multipliciter dici nouit. Illi non quasi multipliciter, sed
quasi ad eundem perpetuo modum dici uelit, accipiunt. Quin etiam is
quod aliquid suo & naturali calore, aut alieno, & acquisititio calidum
sit, non esse idem indicauit. Illi hoc quoque perperam accipiunt. Ad
haec Aristoteles, itemque Theophrastus, quo respicientes temperatam
intemperatam ue naturam esse, iudicare oporteat, diligenter prodiderunt.
Illi ne id quidem intelligunt. Sed cum hos audiunt animal calidum
humidumque dicere, aut puelli temperiem humidam, calidamque esse, nec
quemadmodum ea dicta sint, intelligunt, & stupidi ad quatuor anni
tempora rationem transferunt. Ceu uero idem sit, ac non longo interuallo
dissidens propriam alicuius temperiem humidam, calidamque esse, aut
circundati nobis aeris. Neque enim aut idem est, aut similiter dicitur
animalis temperies calida & humida, sicut aeris temperamentum calidum
dicitur & humidum. Quae igitur sit omnium horum occasio iam dicam,
clareque ostendam, his praesertim, qui intenti esse uolunt, exiguum
errorem in iis, quae inter initia logicae speculationis traduntur,
maximorum errorum occasionem fieri, fortasseque omnibus, quae uel in
cunctis artibus, uel in uitae actionibus perperam geruntur, sophismata
succedunt. Atque haec quidem sophismata illi uitio succedunt, quod
utique non recte definitum est de calidi significationibus. Sed duobus
tantum modis dici id putatum. Quorum altero significetur, quod syncerum
immixtum & simplex est. Altero, quod in mixtione cum suo contrario, id
superat. Quod autem & alteram temperiem cum altera conferentes, subinde
alteram earum calidam pro eo, quod est calidiorem pronunciamus, id non
meminerunt. Atqui ad eum modum animantia ueteribus calida & humida
sunt dicta. Non proprie temperaturae gratia, & sermone absoluto. Immo
ad stirpes, & demortua collata. Quippe demortuis & stirpibus, animantia
calidiora, humidioraque sunt. Quin etiam ex animantibus ipsis speciatim
inter se collatis, canis siccior est, homo humidior. At si formicae
uel api canem conferas, illas sicciores, hunc humidiorem inuenies. Ita
idem animans praeut homo siccum, praeut apicula humidum fuerit. Rursus
ad hominem collatum calidum, ad leonem frigidum erit. Nec mirum, si ad
aliud atque aliud comparatum, contraria simul dici de se patitur. Neque
id alienum est, si idem corpus simul calidum, frigidumque dixeris. Nisi
ad idem conferens sic dixeris. Quod enim incommodum, si eundem hominem
dextrum, sinistrumque dicas? nisi ad eundem conferens ita dicas? Cum ad
alterum dextrum esse, ad alterum sinistrum, nihil sit absoni. Sic igitur
& canis humidus pariter & siccus, praeterea calidus simul & frigidus
est, non tamen ad idem collatus. Quippe ad hominem si conferas, siccus
est, ad formicam, humidus. Rursus hominis respectu calidus est, leonis
frigidus. Quin etiam calidus est, ut uiuens, cum mortuus non amplius sit
calidus. Non calidus, ut ad alterum (si ita uis) canem comparatus. Atque
haec quidem omnia per collationem inter se dicuntur. Quae uero ut in
animantium genere conferuntur. Alia ratione, sicuti etiam quaecunque in
aliqua animalium specie. Canis nanque ad formicam & apim est humidus,
in animantium genere est siccus. Rursus ipsorum speciatim canum, hic
siccus, ille humidus, alius (ut fas est cani) temperatus. Ac dictum
quidem a nobis est, in secundo de pulsuum agnitione de tali nominum usu
diffusissime. Necesse tamen uidetur nunc quoque summatim aliquid, quod
ad rem propositam sit utile, dicendum. Quod absoluto sermone, nec ad
aliud ullum collatum, siccum uocatur, id in solis elementis est, igni,
terraque. Sicut humidum in aqua & aere. Ad eundem modum & de calido,
frigidoque sentiendum. Nullum enim caeterorum corporum prorsus calidum
frigidum ue est, sed sola elementa, quicquid praeter haec ceperis, ex his
mixtis constat. Eoque secundo significationum genere, calidum, frigidum
ue est, non absoluta ratione, ueluti syncerum, & a mixtione alienum.
Immo ueluti uel calidum largius, frigidum partius, uel frigidum largius,
calidum partius sit sortitum reliquorum quiduis calidum, frigidum ue
dicitur. Ac duo quidem significata calidi, frigidi, humidi, & sicci,
haec sunt: alterum absoluto sermone loquentium, mixtura carens, &
syncerum: alterum ex contrariis quidem mixtis constans, caeterum ex
pollentis in mixtura nomine appellatum. Hoc genere sanguis, pituita,
adeps, uinum, oleum, mel, quicquid his simile est, humidum dicitur. Os,
cartilago, unguis, ungula, cornu, pilus, lignum, harena, later, minorem
portionem humidi sunt sortita, maiorem sicci. Eoque eiusmodi omnia sicca
dicuntur. Formica uero sicca est, & uermis humidus: scilicet ut sunt
animalia. Rursus inter ipsos uermes, alius siccus, alius humidus. Idque
uel absolute loquendo, ut uermis, uel alteri cuipiam uermi comparatus.
Caeterum hoc ipsum quod dicimus, ut uermis siccus, ut homo calidus, ut
canis frigidus: nisi quis recte accipiat, & prius intelligit quid sibi
uelit, necesse est omnem sermonem confundat. Est autem recte accipere,
id quod in secundo de pulsibus agnoscendis dicitur, unumquodque secundum
genus, uel speciem non modo calidum, frigidum, humidum, siccum ue: sed
etiam magnum, paruum, celere, tardum, aliaque id genus tunc nominari, cum
supra mediocre, mediumque sit. Verbi gratia, animal calidum cum supra
medium temperie sit animal, equum calidum cum supra medium temperie
sit equum. Porro in quoque genere specie ue media sunt ea, quae Graece
symmetra dicuntur. Quippe quae a summis in eo genere & specie finibus
aequaliter distant. Ac genus quidem est animal: species equus, bos,
canis. Medium temperie in toto animalium genere, homo est. Id enim in
sequentibus demonstrabitur. Medium uero, ut in hominum specie est, quem
Graece eusarcon uocant, Latine, puto, quadratum. Is porro est, quem nec
gracilem dicere, nec crassum possis: sed nec calidum, nec frigidum, nec
alio quouis nomine ex iis, quae excessum defectum ue indicant appellare.
Quisquis super hunc fuerit, is prorsus calidior, frigidior, humidior,
sicciorue est. Nominatur autem talis partim absoluto sermone, partim non
absoluto. Absolute quidem loquenti, quoniam calidus, frigidus, siccus,
humidus ue esse, minime uni alicui priuatim collatus dicitur. Ita enim
canis absoluto quidem sermone, prout uidelicet cuipiam opinio est, animal
siccum dicitur. Non utique alicui comparatus, uerbi gratia formicae.
Non absoluto uero, una quidem ratione, quod scilicet symmetro, id est,
coequali, & medio totius speciei comparatur. Altera uero, quod cum eo
quod inter omnia animalia coequale, & media temperie est, quicquid id
statuas, confertur. Ergo iam palam fit, quod unumquodque eorum, quae
sic dicuntur, nos id uel uni cuicunque comparantes, calidum, frigidum,
humidum ue, aut siccum, ut ad illud dicimus, uel in quocunque genere
specie ue sit dictum, ad eius medium referentes. In specie quidem, ut
equo, cane, boue, platano, cupresso, ficu. Genere uero, ut animali, uel
planta, his accedit & tertium significatum, eorum scilicet, quae absoluto
sermone dicuntur, quae impermixtas summasque habere qualitates diximus
ac elementa uocari. Quin etiam qualitates ipsas est quando corporibus
iis, quae affecta qualitate sunt similiter appellamus. Verum de hoc mox
agetur. Sed ad rem propositam, cum qualitate affecta corpora trifariam
dicantur, consyderandum arbitror in quaque dictione, quemadmodum utamur
appellationibus, utrum ne ut simplex aliquid & immixtum iudicantes, an
ueluti ad symmetron eiusdem generis, uel speciei conferentes, an ueluti
ad rem quamlibet, sicut cum os siccum dicimus, aut frigidum, absoluto
ita sermone nominantes, non adiecto leonis, canis, aut hominis. Palam
nanque est, quod ad uniuersam naturam omnium quae sunt in mundo corporum
respicientes aliquid concipimus medium, cum quo conferentes, ipsum
siccum dicimus. At si quis leonis, uel canis, uel hominis os siccum esse
dicit, liquet hunc rursus ei quod in ipsis animalium ossibus medium
est id comparare. Estque quoniam uniuersorum animalium, aliis magis,
aliis minus sicca ossa sunt hic quoque os aliquod in aliquo animalium
genere intelligendum, quod media temperie sit, uerbi causa hominis,
atque huic reliqua collata, alia humida, alia sicca appellanda. Iam in
ipsis hominibus alius os siccum, alius humidum habere dicetur, utique
ei, qui medius est, ut in hominibus collatus. Quod uero in omnibus quae
sunt, quod medium inter extrema est, id symmetron, atque in illo genere,
uel specie temperatum sit, in omni mihi sermone subaudiendum perpetuo
est, quanquam sit in dictione omissum. Atque cum haec quidem sic se
habeant, ubi aliquis hanc, uel illam humidam, calidam ue temperiem
affirmat, rogandus est quemadmodum dixerit, utrum ne hunc quempiam uni
definito comparans Platoni uerbi gratia Theophrastum, an secundum genus
quodlibet, speciem ue collationem faciens. Quippe uel ut hominem, uel ut
animal, uel ut substantiam absolute, tertium enim significatum cuiusuis
talium nominum, quod simplex esse impermixtumque diximus, id in mixtis
substantiis non est. Sed in ipsis primis, quae etiam uocamus elementa.
Ita cum quodque affectorum qualitate corporum trifariam dicat nobis ad
propositam de temperamentis tractationem, duobus tantum est opus, ut
qui uel ad unum quodlibet, uel ad medium eiusdem generis comparemus.
Quoniam autem multa genera sunt, quemadmodum utique & indiuidua,
poterit multis modis idem corpus, & calidum, & frigidum, & humidum, &
siccum esse. Verum cum uni cuilibet comparatur admodum manifestum est
contraria de eodem dicere licere. Veluti Dionem Theone quidem, & Mennone
sicciorem Aristone, & Glaucone humidiorem. At cum ad medium eiusdem
generis, uel speciei fit collatio, hic iam confundi, conturbarique, qui
parum exercitati sunt, solent. Idem nanque homo humidus simul & calidus
esse potest, sed non minus siccus & frigidus. Verum siccus quidem &
frigidus ad mediocris temperamenti hominem collatus, humidus autem &
calidus, ad aliud quoduis animal stirpem ue, aut substantiam comparatus,
uerbi gratia ad animal, ut apem & formicam: ad stirpem, ut oleam, uel
ficum, uel laurum. Ad aliam uero quampiam substantiam, quae nec animal
sit, nec planta, ut lapidem, ferrum, uel aes. In his uero collationem,
quae ad hominem fit, ad rem eiusdem speciei dixeris. Quae ad apem, uel
formicam est, ad aliquid eiusdem generis. Simili modo quae ad stirpem
fit quamlibet. Est enim supra animal stirpis genus, quemadmodum sane
superioris, quam stirpium generis sunt lapis, ferrum, & aes: uocetur
tamen pro docendi compendio ad omogenes, id est, rem eiusdem generis,
omnis eiusmodi comparatio. Illud modo in ea determinantibus nobis quod
ubi simpliciter substantia quaepiam eucratos, siue temperata dicitur,
tum hac alia siccior, alia humidior, & alia frigidior, alia calidior, eo
loco eam quae ex contrariis aequa prorsus inter se portione coeuntibus
constet, eucraton, siue temperatam nominari. Quaecunque uero ab hac
deficiunt, superantque aliquo ea superantis nomine uocari: ubi uero
stirpem, animans ue ullum eucraton dicimus, nequaquam in ea dictione
simpliciter contraria inter se comparamus. Sed ad naturam uel animalis,
uel stirpis referimus. Ficum uerbi gratia temperatam dicentes, cum
talis sit, qualis maxime ficus esse natura debeat. Rursus canem, suem,
equum, & hominem, cum eorum quisque pro sua natura optime se habeat:
optime uero se habere aliquid pro sua natura ex ipsis functionibus
intelligitur. Quippe animal, ac stirpem quamlibet, tum optime se
habere dicimus, cum optime suam functionem obeunt. Ficus enim uirtus,
bonitasque est, optimos, plurimosque ficos afferre. Ad eundem modum
uitis, plurimas optimasque uuas pendere. Equi uero, quam uelocissime
currere. Canis, ad uenationes quidem, & tutelam quam animosissimum, ad
domesticos quam mitissimum esse. Haec igitur omnia, animalia dico &
stirpes, optimam, mediamque habere in suo genere temperiem dicemus, non
utique absoluto sermone, cum paritas exacta contrariorum in iis sit. Sed
cum ea mediocritas, quae ad potestatem refertur, his adsit. Eiusmodi
aliquid, & iustitiam esse dicimus, non quae pondere, & mensura. Sed
quae eo quod pro dignitate conuenit aequalitatem explorat. Est igitur
temperaturae aequalitas in omnibus temperatis animalibus, stirpibusque,
non ea, quae ex pari elementorum commixtorum spectatur mole, sed quae
tum animalis, tum stirpis naturae conuenit. Conuenit autem alias, ut
humidum sicco, & frigidum calido praeponderet. Neque enim similem habere
temperaturam debent, homo, leo, apis, & canis. Ergo ad quaerentem cuius
sit temperamenti, homo, equus, bos, canis, aliud ue quodlibet, non
est absoluto sermone respondendum. Non enim fieri potest, ut qui ad
ea, quae multis modis sunt dicta, uno modo respondet, non coarguatur.
Oportet igitur duorum alterum, aut omnes percensere differentias, aut
percontatum prius, de qua rogauerit, illam solam dicere. Nam si ut in
animalibus, cuius esset temperamenti rogabat, ad id quod medio est
inter omnia animalia temperamento respicientes, respondere oportet. Si
absolute, atque ut ad omnem substantiam. Sic iam contraria, quae sunt in
eo comparare inter se oportet atque aestimare, haud quaquam ad actionem
temperiem referentes, sed ad elementorum portiones, sin huic cuipiam
singulatim comparans, rogabat, utique ad illud solum conferendo est
respondendum. Iam minus etiam, si indiuiduorum cuiuslibet Dionis, uerbi
gratia uel huius canis, rogemur, quae nam sit substantiae temperatura,
est simplex danda responsio. Dabit enim hinc sophistis, ad calumniam
occasio non parua. Nam si calidi esse temperamenti, & sicci Dionem dicat,
facile licebit illis, partim hominem quemlibet, qui calidioris quam
Dion sit, & siccioris temperamenti proponentibus, ut ad illum humidum,
frigidumque Dionem dicere, partim aliud quoduis animans stirpemue, uerbi
gratia leonem, aut canem, atque his humidiorem, ac frigidiorem asserere
Dionem. Quisquis igitur nec ipse sese fallere, nec ab alio falli uolet,
huic opus est ab his substantiis, quae simpliciter calidae, frigidae,
humidae, siccae dicunt incipere, atque ita transire ad reliquas. Ac
primum quidem illud ipsum in iis exploratum habere, ne has quidem tametsi
maxime uidentur absoluto sermone dici, quo minus ad mediocre eiusdem
generis comparentur effugere, ueluti enim canem medio temperamento
esse omnium canum dicimus, cum pari spatio distat ab extremis, ita
substantiam medio esse temperamento dicemus, cum pari modo ab extremis
abest, quae scilicet & prima omnium sunt & elementa. Porro aberit pars
modo ab extremis, cum ea continet aequaliter inter se mixta. Ergo quae
supra citra ue hanc, temperies erit, eam calidam, frigidam, humidam, uel
siccam dicemus, simul ei, quae media est, conferentes, simul contrariorum
elementorum examen in ea facientes. Qua nimirum ratione simpliciter eam
calidam, frigidam, humidam, siccam ue pronunciabimus: ubi uero cum medio
temperamento conferimus, non simpliciter, sed quod ad mediocre eiusdem
generis sic se habet. Porro genus earum substantia est, omnia enim sub
hac, ut superiori sunt genere, tum animata, tum inanima. Estque haec
hominis, canis, platani, ficus, aeris, ferri, aliorum denique omnium,
commune genus. Sub ea uero sunt alia genera permulta. Animal quidem,
auis, piscis: stirps arboris & herbae: auis, aquilae & corui: piscis,
lupi & rombi. Simili modo oleae & ficus, genus est arbor: anagallidos &
peoniae, herba. Iam haec ultima sunt genera, eoque species appellantur,
coruus, rombus, ficus, anagallis, similiter homo & bos. Ac supernae
quidem descendentibus, haec ultima sunt genera, proinde species dictae.
Inferne uero ascendentibus, ab indiuiduis scilicet substantiis, prima
sunt. Indicatumque alio opere est, merito omnia quae media sunt inter
prima & indiuidua genera, simul genera & species a ueteribus nominari.
Ergo cum definita significata iam sint, ac clare indicatum, quemadmodum
tum absoluto, tum non absoluto sermone calidum, frigidum, humidum, siccum
ue corpus aliquod pronunciandum sit, quaerendae nobis deinceps eorum
sunt notae. Quanquam hic quoque decernere prius de nominibus oportet
quae in habendo nobis sermone, necessario incident, simul explicare
rem quandam, quae potestate iam monstrata prius est, non tamen ab
omnibus, qui hos commentarios euoluent, facile saltem intelligi potest.
Itaque de nominibus prius locutus, mox ad rem reuertar. Quod calidum,
frigidum, humidum, siccum non unum aliquid simpliciter significent,
ubi de corporibus dicuntur, prius est indicatum. Quod autem & solae
ipsae in corporibus qualitates, citra corpora, quae eas suscipiunt, sic
interim nominentur, id quidem, ut nondum est dictum, ita nunc dici est
tempestiuum. Quemadmodum nomen albi tum de colore enunciant, cum ita
loquuntur, contrarius est albus color nigro, tum de corpore, quod colorem
suscipit, cum scilicet oloris corpus album dicunt. Ita & calidi nomen,
tum de qualitate affirmant ipsa, tanquam si caliditatem appellarent,
tum uero de corpore quod caliditatem sustinet. Quippe caliditatem a
corpore quod eam suscipit diuersam habere naturam, & propriam existimare
oportet, ueluti in opere de elementis est indicatum. Et caliditas
quidem qualitas est, eadem uero & calidum dicitur, ueluti & albedo
album. Ipsum uero corpus calidum, unum hoc nomen tantummodo optinet,
calidum, sicuti album. Nunquam tamen caliditas, uel albedo, corpus ipsum
dicitur. Ad eundem modum siccum, frigidum, & humidum, nominantur tum
ipsum corpus, tum qualitas. Non tamen corpus frigiditas, humiditas,
uel siccitas appellatur, quemadmodum quae in eo est qualitas, haec cum
sic se habeant, non alienum est, cum uel caliditatem, uel frigiditatem
disputans quis profert, nullam exoriri captionem. Quod solae qualitates
his indicentur nominibus. At calidum, frigidum ue cum dicitur, quando
& qualitas ita, & quod eam suscipit, corpus nominatur, facile fit ei,
qui redarguere studet, ut quod a loquente non significatur, id quo
possit reprehendere, accipiat. Eiusmodi enim rem faciunt, qui sententiam
illam, qua dicit Hyppocrates augescentia corpora plurimum habere
innatum calidum, oppugnant. Neque enim esse corpus aliquod calidum,
ipsum innatum animali calidum intelligentes, neque id quid sit usquam
quaerentes, sed de sola qualitate, quam scilicet caliditatem appellamus
nomen id dici praesumentes, sic dictum eius refellere parant. Et iam
apparet, quod de homonymia distinguere, tametsi sit res parua, tamen
in rerum usu non leuis experitur momenti, uerum cum hoc quoque abunde
sit definitum, rursum id quod superest, repetamus. Cum humiditas, &
siccitas, & caliditas, & frigiditas, syncerae quaedam, & impermixtae
qualitates sunt, quaecunque has suscipere corpora ea calida, & frigida,
sicca, & humida, prorsus exactaeque sunt. Atque haec mihi genitorum,
& pereuntium elementa intellige. Reliqua corpora uel animalium, uel
stirpium, uel inanimorum omnium, ueluti aeris, ferri, lapidum, lignorum,
in medio primorum illorum collocata esse. Nullum enim aliorum uel ad
summum calidum, uel ad summum frigidum, uel ad summum humidum, uel ad
summum siccum est. Sed uel medium prorsus contrariorum, ita ut nihilo
magis sit calidum, quam frigidum, aut humidum quam siccum, uel ad alterum
contrariorum est propensum, ita ut magis sit calidum, quam frigidum, uel
magis sit humidum quam siccum, ac siquidem medium plane sit in utroque
contrariorum genere, ita ut non magis sit calidum quam frigidum, aut
humidum quam siccum, eucraton id siue temperatum omnino dicetur. Sin
alterum contrariorum superet, siue in altera oppositione, siue in
utraque id sit, non etiam dicetur eucraton. Ac si calidum magis sit quam
frigidum, quod magis est, id appellabitur. Idem statuendum de sicco, &
humido. Ad eundem modum si frigidum magis sit, nominabitur frigidum.
At si in utraque oppositione alterum superet, siue calidum una cum
humido, siue calidum simul cum sicco, siue frigidum simul cum humido,
siue frigidum una cum sicco, utique pro uincenti sortietur id corpus
appellationem. Et has quidem quatuor intemperies, ut supra diximus,
plurimi norunt, tum medici, tum philosophi. Reliquas quatuor, quae ex
dimidio harum constitutae sunt, nescio quomodo derelinquunt, sicut etiam
eam, quae prima omnium, optimaque est. Caeterum quod superante calido
liceat nihilo magis humidam esse, quam siccam temperiem: quod utique
ad hanc spectet coniugationem, id uel ex iis, quae iam dicta sunt,
manifestum arbitror, facileque est etiam si nihil esset praedictum, id
colligere. Concedentibus semel illud saltem, alteram esse temperiem
humidam & calidam, alteram siccam & calidam. Si nanque necessarium omnino
non est siccam esse, quae calida sit, sed licet eam & humidam esse,
licebit utique & mediam esse: propior nanque siccae temperaturae media
est, quam humida. Ad eundem modum est & frigida quaedam temperies altera,
in qua nimirum frigidum pollet: hanc tamen nec humidam esse, nec siccam,
est necesse. Sed potest inter has & media esse. Rursus enim hic quoque
eandem afferes rationem. Nempe si necesse non est frigidam temperiem esse
humidam: sed licet & siccam eam fieri manifestum est, mediam quoque esse
posse. Quippe quae uicinior humidae est quam sicca. Ergo ueluti duae
intemperies in altera oppositione sunt monstratae, altera calida tantum,
altera frigida. Sic in altera oppositione duae aliae statuantur, altera
sicca tantum, altera humida, mediocriter scilicet sese habentibus calido
& frigido. Iterum nanque dicemus hic quoque, sicuti necesse non est, si
qua temperies sicca est, hanc protinus calidam quoque esse. Sed fieri
posse, ut etiam frigida sit, ita fieri potest, ut quaepiam nec calida
sit nec frigida. Sed in hac quidem oppositione eucratos, siue temperata,
in altera, sicca. Simili modo nec humidam temperiem necesse est calidam,
frigidam ue esse. Sed eam mediam esse inter huius oppositionis extrema
licet. Si igitur necesse non est, ut uel intemperiem, quae in calido
est & frigido, sequatur ea quae est in altera oppositione intemperies,
uel hanc, quae in illa, licebit aliquando & naturam, quae in caliditate
& frigiditate temperata sit, uel siccam esse, uel humidam. Inuicemque
quae in his temperata sit, uel calidam esse, uel frigidam, quare sunt &
hae ab iis, quas priores tum medici, tum philosophi nobis tradiderunt
quatuor diuersae intemperies. Medioque loco positae inter temperatos
habitus, & eos qui in utraque oppositione sunt intemperati. Qui nanque in
summo est temperatus, is neutram oppositionem habet superantem. Qui uero
aduersus huic est intemperatus, utramque habet uitiosam. Medium sortitur
locum, qui in altera quidem est temperatus, in altera intemperatus, qui
utique & ex dimidio eucratos, ex dimidio intemperatus cum sit, merito
medius dici potest inter eum, qui ex toto est temperatus, & eum qui ex
toto est intemperatus. Et si quidem haec sic se habent, sicut certe
se habent, cur nouem dicere uniuersas temperamentorum differentias
dubitemus. Temperatam quidem unam, non temperatas octo, quarum quatuor
simplices sint, humida, sicca, calida, & frigida, quatuor compositae
humida simul & calida, sicca pariter & calida, frigida simul & humida,
frigida simul & sicca. In quolibet uero iam dictorum temperamentorum
permagnus est excessus, defectusque modus non in iis modo quae simplicia
sunt. Sed etiam in compositis. Idque tum in tota substantia. Tum uero
in unoquoque genere. Si cui igitur agnoscendorum temperamentorum cura
est, incipiat exercitationem oportet ab iis in quolibet genere naturis,
quae temperatae, mediaeque sunt. Quippe cum si his alias comparet facile
quod in quauis superet deficiat ue inuenerit. Ergo primum de iis, quae
simpliciter loquentibus, temperata, intemperataque dicuntur, agendum,
quae scilicet in omni generata substantia, non in solis animalibus
& stirpibus disquirenda diximus. Porro hic quoque tantillum saltem
distinguere de nominibus conueniet, quod calida temperies, alia iam
energia, siue, ut loquuntur actu sit, alia potestate, tum quod potestate
ea esse dicamus, quae quod dicuntur, id nondum sint: sed facile id
fieri possint. Quoniam naturalem, ut id fiant facultatem sint adepta.
Igitur primum de iis, quae actu calida, frigida, humida, & sicca sunt,
disseramus, auspicati ab uniuersa substantia. Mox ad animalia & stirpes
discensuri. Ita enim consummationem habebit, quod institutum nobis est.
Quoniam igitur quod in omnium genere, maximeque in uniuersa substantia
medium est, id ex mixtione extremorum conflatur, utique conueniet,
ut tum noticia eius tum agnitio ex illis sumatur. Ac noticia quidem
facillima est. Quippe a calidissimo omnium, quae sub sensum ueniunt,
ueluti igni, aut quapiam aqua, quae ad summum sit feruens ad id, quod
omnium, quae nobis apparent, est frigidissimum, ueluti glaciem, &
niuem uenientes, aestimato interea interuallo, in medio ad unguem id
diducimus. Sic enim symmetron, quod scilicet ab utroque extremorum pari
abest spacio, intellectu comprehendemus. Quin etiam id nobis praeparare
licet. Miscentibus aquae feruenti parem modum glaciei. Quod enim ex
ambobus est mixtum pari interuallo ab utroque extremorum aberit, & eo
quod urit, & eo quod frigore stupefacit. Non est igitur difficile ei, qui
ita mixtum tetigerit, medium uniuersae substantiae in calidi frigidique
oppositione habere, eiusque meminisse, atque alia omnia illi ueluti norme
adaptata iudicare. Quin etiam si terram, quae sicca sit, uel cinerem,
uel tale aliquid quod plane sit aridum, pari aquae modo imbueris, medium
in sicci humidique oppositione effeceris. Ergo ne hic quidem difficile
est ubi uisu pariter, tactuque eiusmodi corpus noueris memoriae id
infigere, eoque ad humidorum, ac siccorum, quae deficiant, superent ue
agnitionem pro norma, exemplarique uti. Porro corpus de quo iudicandum
est, mediocriter calens est. Nam hoc ipsum humidi, siccique medium
corpus si ad summum id calorem frigus ue sit perductum, falsam interim
imaginationem excitabit, uidebiturque quam sit mediocre, aliquando
humidius, aliquando siccius. Quippe si liberalius calefiat, liquatum iam,
ac fluxile, humidioris substantiae phantasiam de se praebebit contra
refrigeratum plus iusto, consistit, ac cogitur, immobileque redditur,
& durum tangenti apparet. Vnde etiam falsam siccitatis imaginationem
exhibet. Quod si ueluti humidi siccique parem modum habet, sic caloris,
ac frigoris sit in medio, nec durum, nec molle tangenti apparebit
id corpus. Atque tota quidem eiusmodi corpora per tota se miscendi,
calidum, inquam, frigidum, siccum, & humidum, homini facultas non est.
Terra enim aquae confusa, miscetur quidem (quatenus scilicet uideri
cuipiam possit) atque ita tota toti contemperatur. Caeterum appositio
exiguarum partium ea est, nequaquam totorum per tota mixtio. Sed ambo ea
per tota miscere, dei, uel naturae est opus, magisque etiam si calidum,
ac frigidum inter se tota per tota miscenda sint. Attamen appositionem
eiusmodi efficere, ut sensum effugiant singula simplicium corporum, non
solum naturae opus dei ue est. Sed etiam nostrum. Neque enim difficile
est tali mixtione, lutum, quod medium sicci, humidique sit, moliri.
Simili modo & quod calidi ac frigidi sit medium, uidebiturque tibi
eiusmodi corpus in calore & frigore temperatum: immo etiam in duricie,
mollicieque medio statu esse. Id autem genus est hominis cutis, utpote
omnium extremorum calidi, frigidi, humidi, sicci uere media. Maximeque
ea, quae est in manu, haec enim omnium sensibilium ueluti norma futura
erat prudentissimo, nimirum animantium tactus instrumentum ab ipsa natura
praeparata. Quo magis eam ab omnibus extremis calido inquam, frigido,
sicco, & humido pari abesse interuallo oportuit. Iam utique & constat ex
horum omnium equis portionibus, non compositis modo, sed etiam per totas
se mixtis, quod nostrum plane nemo efficere potest: Sed est naturae opus.
Quaecunque igitur partes cute sunt duriores, ueluti ossa cartilagines,
cornua, pili, ungues, ligamenta, ungulae, calcaria, in his omnibus siccum
praeualet. Quaecunque uero molliores sunt, sicuti sanguis, pituita,
seuum, adeps, cerebrum, medulla tum spinalis, tum altera, in his humidi
plus est, quam sicci. Quin etiam quanto siccissima omnium quae sunt
in homine pars cutem siccitate superat, tanto rursus acute superatur,
quod est humidissimum, porro uidetur nunc disceptatio nostra, ea quae
utilissima sunt attingere, ac docere simul quod tum animalium, tum uero
omnium corporum temperatissimus sit homo. Simul quod omnium, quae in
eo sunt particularum cutis, quae intra manum habetur omnis excessus
plane sit expers. Insistentes igitur hoc loco, estimemus quisnam sit
optime temperatus homo, quem scilicet totius substantiae, uel potius
tum hominum, tum reliquorum animalium medium, ueluti regulam & normam
statuentes, reliquos omnes huic collatos calidos frigidos, humidos,
siccos ue dicere oportet. Concurrant ergo oportet in hoc homine multae
notae, quippe & cum uniuersa substantia collatus, medius apparere in ea
debet, & magis etiam cum hominibus & bestiis. Ac medii quidem in uniuersa
substantia, communes notae dictae iam sunt. Quae uero in animalium
speciebus notantur, actionis perfectione quae cuique sit conueniens
iudicantur. Conuenit autem homini, ut sit sapientissimus, cani, ut
mitissimus pariter sit & fortissimus, leoni, ut tantum sit fortissimus.
Sicuti oui, ut sit tantum mitissima. Iam uero quod corporis actiones
consentientes esse animi moribus oporteat, tum Aristoteli in his, quae
de partibus animalium scripsit, tum uero nobis alibi nihilominus est
monstratum. Ac methodus quidem haec est. Exercitari uero, ut non in
singulis modo animalium generibus, sed etiam in uniuersis medium in
promptu quis noscat, id cuiuslibet hominis non est: sed diligentis
imprimis, & qui per longam experientiam, & multam omnium particularium
peritiam, inuenire medium queat. Quippe ad eundem modum plastae,
pictores, statuarii, alii denique fictores, quae pulcherrima in omni
specie sunt, tum pingunt, tum fingunt, ueluti hominem, equum, bouem,
leonem formosissimum, ad id quod medium est in illa specie collineantes,
laudantque homines quandam Polycleti statuam canonem appellatam. Inde
adeo id nomen sortitum, quod partium inter se omnium competentiam ad
unguem habeat: habet autem quem nunc quaerimus, plus aliquid, quam Canon
ille. Quum non solum humoris ac siccitatis in medio consistat, is qui
eusarcos, siue quadratus est homo: sed etiam optimam formationem sit
adeptus. Quae fortasse bonam quatuor elementorum temperiem est comitata,
fortasse diuiniorem aliquam superne originem habet. Caeterum prorsus
eusarcon saltem esse eiusmodi hominem, id uero est necessarium. Quippe
mediocritas in carne, ex mediocritate temperamenti prouenit: protinus
autem adsequitur tale corpus, ut optime ad actiones sit comparatum. Tum
in mollicie, & duritia praeterea calore ac frigore mediocriter se habeat,
atque haec omnia insint cuti, huiusque maxime illi parti, quae est intra
manum. Scilicet quae callum eiusmodi non contraxit, qualis in remigibus
& fossoribus cernitur. Cum enim gemini usus causa manus sunt factae,
tactu discernendi, & rem quampiam comprehendendi utique quae molles sunt
ad exquisitius tangendum, durae ad aliquid maiore ui capiendum magis sunt
idoneae. Quin etiam cutis, quae non solum omnium hominis partium, sed
etiam uniuersae, quae generationi, corruptionique subiicitur substantiae
media est, ea nec callosa, nec dura lapidea ue est, sed secundum naturam
se habens, quo scilicet cutis genere maxime perfectum esse tactum
censemus. Ac quod in duritia & mollicie medium omnium particularum locum
sit sortita, abunde liquet. Quod autem & in calore, ac frigore similiter
se habeat, ex eius substantia maxime intelligas licet. Est enim ueluti
sanguine praeditus neruus, qui sit inter neruum, & carnem quiddam plane
medium. Ac si ex mixtis utrisque constitueretur. Caeterum neruus,
omnis exanguis est & frigidus. Caro multisanguinis & calida. Media
inter utrunque est cutis. Nec plane exanguis ut neruus, nec sanguine
abundans, ut caro, si igitur hanc omnium animalis partium, ueluti normam.
Iudicemque proponens, reliqua illi conferas, atque ad eam examines, octo
diuersas intemperies in eis inuenies. Iamque membratim tibi de omnibus
deinceps disseram, humidissimum, frigidissimumque in corpore pituita
est. Calidissimum sanguis, non tamen est is perinde humidus, ut pituita.
Siccissimum ac frigidissimum est pilus. Minus eo & frigidum & siccum est
os, hoc uero minus siccum est cartilago. Proxime hanc sequitur, quem
Graeci ex cartilagine & ligamento composito nomine, chondrosyndesmon
uocant, post hunc tendo, deinceps membrana, & arteria, & uena, ipsa
scilicet corpora uasorum. Succedunt deinde nerui duri: molles autem nerui
in humiditate & siccitate, mediam naturam, sicuti cutis optinent. Nam
in altera oppositione, quae est calidi & frigidi neruus mollis in medio
non est. Sed tantum ei defit de calore, quantum de sanguine. Ita uero
& reliqua omnia prius dicta, tanto sunt cute frigidiora, quanto minus
habent sanguinis. Etiam tunicae ipsae, maxime sanguineorum uasorum,
arteriarum, dico & uenarum, non solum exangues sunt, sed etiam frigidae
natura contactu tamen sanguinis calefiunt, atque ad medium temperamenti
statum ueniunt. Sanguis uero ipse, a corde suum accipit calorem. Quippe
id uiscus natura tum omnium animalis particularum maxime sanguineum, tum
uero calidissimum est: proximum illi iecur est, uerum cor paulo quam
cutis minus est durum, iecur multo. Itaque etiam humidius quam cutis
cor est, quanto scilicet est mollius. Iam uero caro humidior cute est,
eadem tamen calidior. Spinalis autem medulla cute est humidior, atque
etiam frigidior. Sicuti hac rursus humidius est cerebrum: cerebro autem
ipso adeps cui concretio contingit, propterea quod membranis adiacet.
Crasso nanque oleo est simile. Eoque congelatur, ubi cum frigidis, &
exanguibus particulis coniungitur. At neque circa iecur coire adeps
potest, neque circa arterias, uenas ue, aut cor. Sed nec circa aliam
ullam praecalidam particulam. Quoniam autem cogitur per id, quod ualde
est frigidum, idcirco calefacta liquatur, caeterorum congelatorum ritu.
At cerebrum calefactum minime liquatur, eoque adipe minus est humidum.
Porro minus humida quam adeps, est & pulmonum caro. Vt quae nec ipsa
calefacta liquescat. Iam longe etiam quam haec adipe minus humida est,
tum lienis, tum renum caro. Omnia tamen cute sunt humidiora, harum rerum
demonstrationes proximo libro tradam, sicuti omnia quae ad uniuersam
de temperamentis disputationem pertinent, duobus deinceps comentariis
exponam.

Ac quod multifariam quidem dicatur, humidum, siccum, calidum, & frigidum
corpus in proximo definitum est libro, demonstratum praeterea est, nouem
esse temperamentorum differentias, unam quidem quae mediocris sit &
eucratos, quam etiam temperatam uocamus. Reliquas omnes intemperatas
quatuor simplices, unica scilicet in quaque pollente qualitate,
calore, frigore, siccitate, uel humiditate: quatuor ab his diuersas,
in quibus utriusque oppositionis altera qualitas exuperat, dico autem
duas oppositiones, alteram quae est calidi & frigidi, alteram quae est
humidi et sicci. Ab his ad notas earum digressi, de temperata natura
disceptauimus, quoniam haec omnium prima uirtute, potentia cognitionisque
ordine sit. At cum temperatum aliud absolute dictum inueniatur in
uniuersa rerum natura. Aliud in singulis generibus, principio uisum est
de eo consyderandum esse, quod communiter in uniuersa natura estimatur,
huius norma, inditiumque erat, elementorum portionis aequalitas. Cuius
rei gratia extremorum omnium medium ad unguem redditum, eucraton &
symmetron, siue temperatum & mediocre mauis, dicitur. Reliqua quae in
singulis generibus temperata dicuntur propriis corporum functionibus
usibusque iudicantur. Eoque fit, ut idem animalis cuiuspiam stirpis
ue corpus, omnium quae in eodem sunt genere, medium esse possit, id
est, in illo genere eucraton & mediocre. Alteri cuipiam comparatum,
uel stirpium, uel animalium, uel inanimorum generi, discraton, siue
intemperatum. Quippe uiuentis corpus cum demortui collatum, humidius
eo, calidiusque est, uerbi gratia, leo uiuens, leone mortuo, tum ipse
seipso, tum alter altero calidior, humidiorque est. Atque inde adeo
dictum ueteribus est, animal calidum & humidum esse. Non absoluto
sermone, quod humiditas in eo, calor ue, exuperet (Sic enim inuenire
est animalia sicca, frigidaque complura, ueluti culices, muscas, apes,
formicas) sed ut ad mortua collata: uiua enim apes calidior humidiorque
quam mortua est, & formica uiua, quam mortua. Cum homine tamen, equo,
boue ue collata, tum aliis sanguine praeditis animalibus, omnia id genus
frigida, siccaque temperie sunt. Quin si ad uniuersam naturam spectans
ea expendas, ne sic quidem quo minus frigida, siccaque sint, elabantur.
Tanquam enim in unoquoque genere, ubi quid a mediocritate recessit, ab eo
quod uincit, nomen accipit. Itidem in uniuersa substantia, cum aliquid
medium transierit, non amplius eucraton, sed uel calidum, uel frigidum,
uel humidum, uel siccum nominabitur. Monstratum enim supra est hominem
non solum animalium, stirpium ue: sed etiam reliquorum omnium maxime
esse temperatum. Quoniam autem ex multis & dissidentibus is conditus est
partibus, manifestum est quae pars medio omnium sit temperamento, eam
esse maxime eucraton, siue temperatam. Quae nanque animalis eius quod
medii sit temperamenti, media particula est, haec omnium simpliciter
est temperatissima. Monstratum uero est id esse in homine cutem. Atque
huius eam maxime partem, quae in manu est interna. Si tamen qualem
eam natura est molita, talis perstiterit. Iam uero quod nec cuiusque
hominis cutis medium absolute loquendo sit uniuersae substantiae. Sed
eius qui maxime est temperatus, dictum prius est. Plurimam enim esse
ipsis quoque hominibus inter se differentiam, uerum maxime temperatus
is est, qui corporis habitu, medius horum extremorum ad unguem apparet,
gracilitatis, crassitudinis, duricie, molliciei itemque caloris, &
frigoris. Inuenias enim cuiuslibet hominis tangendo corpus, uel mitem
& halituosum calorem, uel igneum, & acrem, uel horum neutrum, Immo
frigiditatem quandam pollentem, frigiditatem autem pollere ut in hominis
corpore intelligere oportet. Eoque tum sanguineo, tum humido. Ac corpore
quidem talis est temperatissimus homo. Idem animo quoque medius omnino
est, audaciae & timoris. Cunctationis & praecipitationis, misericordiae,
& inuidiae: fuerit uero talis alacer amicorum amans, humanus, & prudens.
Et temperatissimus quidem homo ex his primum, potissimumque agnoscitur.
Accedunt non pauca eorum, quae ex necessitate haec sequuntur. Quippe
edit, bibitque in modo, & nutrimenta non solum in uentre, sed etiam in
uenis, & tota corporis mole, probe concoquit. Omnesque (ut semel dicam)
tum naturales, tum animales uirtutes inculpatas habet. Cum & sensuum
facultatibus, & membrorum motibus optimis sit praeditus, & tum uiuido
colore semper sit, tum ad perspiratum excrementorum bene comparatus.
Idem medius inter somnolentum & peruigilem, inter glabrum & hirtum,
inter nigrum colorem & album, pilosque habeat cum puer est magis rufos
quam nigros, cum in flore est contra. At quoniam differentiarum, quae
ex aetate eius spectantur, mentionem feci, non alienum sit, aliquid
iam de iis quoque apponere. Porro uolebam unius cuiusque praedictarum
notarum causas persequi, uerum cum ad ea, quae nunc sunt proposita
magis urgeat aetatum consyderatio, quae etiam maximam nobis ad causarum
inuentionem facultatem suggerit, huic nunc insistamus. Intelligamus
igitur recens formatum animal in utero matris, quo sciamus qua ratione
humidissimum, calidissimumque sit, prima enim eius constitutio ex
semine & sanguine est, quae humidae & calidae res sunt, his autem magis
semper siccescentibus, primum quidem formantur membranae, tunicae,
item uiscera & sanguis uasa, ultima uero perficiuntur ossa, & ungues,
& cartilagines, concreta scilicet eorum substantia. Ante enim quam
uel tendi possit subiecta substantia, uel concrescere, nihil fieri
memoratorum potest. Et tunicae quidem, ac membranae, arteriaeque,
& nerui, & uenae, tensa ea, ossa, cartilagines, ungues, ungulae, &
uiscera, coagulata ea perficiuntur. His uero in utero perfectis ita
deinde paritur infans. Est uero adhuc in summo humidus, ueluti maris
alga. Idque non in sanguinis uasis modo & uisceribus, ac carne, sed
etiam ipsis ossibus, quae scilicet siccissima sunt omnium quae in nobis
sunt, partium. Verum tum haec, tum reliqua tota una cum his membra
quasi cerea sint, infantium nutrices fingunt, formantque. Tanta est
in toto puellorum corpore humiditas. Quin si recens editum porcellum,
uel esse, uel dissectum inspicere uelis: carnem quidem eius muccosam,
praehumidamque inuenies. Osseum uero genus uniuersum, caseo qui modo
sit coagulatus ad simile. Adeo, ut nuper nati animalis corpus propter
redundantem in eo humorem libens non comedas. Quod maxime tum suilli,
tum ouilli foetus corpori accidit, propterea quod ea maxime sunt humida.
Caprinum, quod siccius sit, & melius esui est & iucundius. Contra uero
quam in nouellis procellis, quaecunque iam senuerunt, haec ossa quidem
omnia & ligamenta uniuersa, praesicca, sine succo, & insipida possident.
Carnem uero neruosam & duram. Arterias quoque & uenas, & neruos, aetatis
culpa lori uice, insuaues, & sine succo. Quae medio statu horum, ac nuper
natorum sunt, quae utique iam aetate processerunt quantum a senio absunt,
tantum & ab extrema siccitate sunt remota. Quae minora sunt, atque adhuc
augescunt, tantum ea quoque ab gestati etiamnum foetus humore absunt,
quantum processerunt aetate. Florescens uero aetas omnium animalium
maxime in medio extremorum est, neque sicut senium ad summam perducta
siccitatem, neque ueluti infantium aetas in humore & multo uuido mersa.
Cur igitur aliqui celebrium medicorum humidum esse senium, prodiderunt.
An uidelicet quod excrementorum abundantia sunt decepti. Quippe tum
oculi his lacrimis suffunduntur tum nares destillatione manant. Tum in
ore eorum saliuae copia exuberat. Ad haec tum tussiunt, tum excreant
pituitam. Scilicet pulmones quoque hac esse refertos iudicantes, uenter
quoque illis pituita est plenus. Tum singuli articuli quodamodo muccosi.
Caeterum nihil horum obstat, quo minus senum corpora sicca censeantur. Vt
quorum neruos & arterias, & uenas, & membranas, & omnium instrumentorum
tunicas, multo quam prius erant, sicciores inuenias. Circumfundi autem
illis extrinsecus, intrinsecus ue, aut pituitosum quendam humorem,
ut muccosum. Verum tantum abest, ut eiusmodi signa uniuersa senilem
aetatem humidam confirment, ut etiam siccam esse prope testentur. Idcirco
nanque particula quaeuis siccior, quam ante uidetur, quod per caloris
imbecillitatem, similiter non nutritur, foris enim copia illi, humidi
excrementi superfluitat. Corpus autem cuiusque intrinsecus, siccum est,
quod nec trahere intro nutrimentum ualeat, nec eo sufficienter frui.
Est ergo humidus senex, non propriis suis particulis, sed excrementis.
Rursum siccus, non excrementis, sed particulis ipsis. Ita nimirum alio
genere siccus, alio humidus. Verum non est ad praesens de excrementis
eius, sed de propriis partibus disceptatio, quarum propriae actiones
uitam eius complent: his igitur siccus senex est, quibus scilicet
puer est humidus. Ipsis nimirum solidis corporis particulis, ossibus,
membranis, ligamentis, arteriis, uenis, neruis, tunicis, carnibusque.
Meritoque Aristoteles senium marcenti stirpi adsimilat. Quippe stirpes
nouellae dum sunt, molles, humidaeque cernuntur, senescentes assidue
magis siccescere uidentur. Ad postremum siccae prorsus redduntur. Idque
ipsis mors est. Ac quod siccissima aetatum senilis sit, ex iam dictis
liquet. Quod autem & frigidissima sit, id uel magis est euidens. Ita ut
de eo nemo dubitauerit. Nam & tangenti senes frigidi apparent, & facile
in frigidum statum mutantur. Et nigri, & liuidi fiunt, & frigidis morbis
facile capiuntur. Apoplexia neruorum resolutione, stupore, tremore,
conuulsione, destillatione, raucedine. Porro periit eorum omnis paulo
minus sanguis. Eoque una periit & coloris rubor. Iam uero concoctio his,
& digestio, & sanguificatio, & appositio, & nutritio, & appetentia, &
sensus, & motus, oblaesa omnia sunt, uitioseque administrata. Et quid,
quaeso, aliud est senium, quam uia ad interitum? Ita si mors naturalis
caloris est extinctio, utique senium ueluti tabes quaedam eius fuerit.
Verum non perinde de puerorum, & florentium aetate inter medicos
conuenit. Sed nec dirimere inter eos litem est promptum, probabiles enim
sunt utrorumque rationes, tum eorum, qui pueros calidiores esse, quam
florentes aetate censent. Tum eorum, qui contra, florentes calidiores
pueris esse contendunt. Alteri nanque ex eo quod sanguinis humor
omnium, quae in animalis habentur corpore calidissimum natura sit, tum
quod foetus in utero propemodum sanguis tantum sit post enim fingendis
utique iam particulis, aliud os efficitur, aliud arteria, aliud uena,
aliud diuersum ab his aliquid: omnia tamen rubra, tum quod sanguinem
syncerissimum, calidissimumque optineat: colligunt calidissimum esse
gestatum in utero foetum. Quod si est etiam pueros quanto gestatis in
utero propiores sunt, tanto esse florentibus aetate calidiores. Alteri
quod etiam plurimus sit in florentibus sanguis, ac copiosior quam in
pueris. Ita ut eius occasione crebro his sanguis profluat. Quin etiam
quod flauae bilis succus, qui sanguine multo est calidior, plurimus
his sit, propterea calidiores esse florentes, quam pueros, confirmant.
Rursus illi ab ipsis functionibus quod tum augeantur, tum plura, quam pro
corporis sui portione, alimenta tum appetant, tum conficiant, ualidum
esse in pueris calorem asserunt. Hi contra humiditatis occasione,
potius, quam caloris ui, augeri illos contendunt. At concoctione non
modo florentes non uincere, sed etiam longe ab iis pueros uinci. Nam
& uomitiones iis ex incoctis cibis accidere, & deiectiones humidas,
asperasque, ac a succo alienas. Quod si appetunt plura, nihil id facere
ad caloris robur. Primum enim id non accidere caloris copia, ut animal
appetat plura. Immo contra, refrigeratis scilicet his partibus, quibus
appetentia debetur. Deinde quoniam non tantum ad nutritionem, sed etiam
incrementum, alimentum moliuntur. Idcirco etiam pluribus nutrimentis
iis esse opus. Iam uero reliquis functionibus uniuersis, etiam non
obscure, inferiores esse pueros his, qui florenti sunt aetate, ut qui
nec ingredi, nec currere, nec portare, nec quicquam in summa agendorum
operum similiter obire queant. Cum florentibus, tum sensum omnem, tum
intellectum ad summam perfectionem, bonitatemque peruenisse dicant. In
summa puerum adhuc imperfectum esse florentem, animal perfectum. In
perfectis rationabile esse, maxime actiuum maximeque princeps elementum
pollere. Quin somno quoque plurimo deditos pueros uidere licet, contra
minimo florentes esse contentos. Quanquam hunc quoque, aliter accidere,
ne insanum quidem hominem censere aiunt, quam calido uicto quodammodo
grauatoque humoris copia, ueluti tum ex temulentis intelligere licet,
tum iis, qui balneo liberalius sint usi. Ita uero & papauer somnificum
esse, & mandragoram, & lactucam, & omnia quae humidiore, frigidioreque
temperie sunt. Ac tales quidem de propositarum aetatum temperie rationes
utrinque afferuntur. Omnes enim recensere, superuacuum uidetur. Cum
formula ipsa epicherematum, uel ex iis, quae retulimus, satis clare
perspici possit. Eminus enim utrique, fermeque a secundis priora
colligunt. Ac tanquam iam sciat auditor quemadmodum auctio, quemadmodum
concoctio, & quemadmodum nutritio fiat, uerba faciunt. Simili modo de
sensu, de motu, de functionibus, tum naturalibus, tum quae agi sunt
idoneae, disputant. De somni quoque generatione & ciborum natura,
mentionem faciunt, quorum nullum simplex promptumque cognitu est. Sed
& multam disquisitionem requirit, nec potest fortasse ulli compertum
esse, nisi qui prius humidam, siccam, calidam, frigidamque temperiem
sciat agnoscere. Quicquid enim eorum ueluti scientes dicunt, id si docere
eos cogas, prorsus disputationem de temperamentis, hanc scilicet cui
nunc insistimus, desyderabunt. Quare per mutua & ex mutuis, fiunt iis
demonstrationes. Ex iis quidem quae nunc quaerimus, ceu iam sint cognita,
cum de actionibus disputant, & ciborum ac medicamentorum facultates
inuestigant, ac de somno, & aliis id genus disserunt. Rursus autem quae
nunc sunt proposita per illa, ueluti prius iam nota demonstrant. Ego uero
eiusmodi demonstrationes non probo, quin si fateri uerum oportet, nec
demonstrationes eas censeo, ueluti diffusius in aliis ostendi, satiusque
esse in omni docendi genere existimo, ordinem conceptionum diffinire. Si
igitur principium omnis quae de temperamentis suscipitur disputationis,
tractatio de elementis est, sint ne ea impatibilia prorsusque mutationis
expertia, an alterari, mutarique potentia, ab illorum uero cognitione,
secunda deinceps est, proposita nunc disputatio, non utique sumenda
est istorum fides ex iis, quae nondum sciuntur, sed sicuti tum rectum
est, tum uero iustum, quod sumendum ad demonstrationem est, uel euidens
aliquid sit oportet, uel quod prius fuit demonstratum. Non est igitur
neque de somni generatione mentio facienda, neque de concoctione,
neque auctione, neque de alio id genus ullo, sed ab ipsa sola, nudaque
subiectarum rerum substantia, disquisitio ineunda, sicuti in primo libro
fecimus. Quippe statuentes aliud esse, quod energia, siue actu sit, aliud
quod potestate, de eo quod actu iam calidum, frigidum, humidum, siccum ue
sit, prius disserendum esse diximus, subinde ad ea quae potestate sint
ueniendum. Porro eorum, quae actu, calida, frigida, humida, sicca, ue
sunt, obuia, promptaque omnibus cognitio est, utpote quae tactu discerni
queant. Qui scilicet, & ignem ipsum calidum esse docuit, & glaciem
frigidam. Quod si alia quapiam ratione notionem, agnitionemque calidi,
frigidi ue habent, dicant hanc nobis. Inauditam enim ac nullius effectus
sapientiam promittunt. Immo si uerum fateri licebit stuporem potius,
si rerum sensibilium alium quempiam habere se iudicem meliorem putant,
quam ipse sit sensus. Atqui si eorum, quae actu calida sunt, alius esse
iudex quam tactus, nullus potest, tangant iam deinceps multos uiros, tum
senes, tum adolescentes, tum pueros, tum infantes. Ita enim inuenient,
qui magis, minus ue calidi sint. Sin de rebus sensibilibus rationales
demonstrationes quaerunt, iam de niue ipsa inquirendum est, censenda
ne sit, sicut omnibus hominibus apparet, candida, an sicut Anaxagoras
asseuerauit, non candida. Iam uero de pice simili modo coruoque, ac
reliquis omnibus estimandum. Neque enim si non habenda est oculis fides
de albo quod uident, de nigro sine demonstratione fides est habenda.
Omnia igitur quae sensui apparent, si iam fide carere dicunt, nec olorem
album esse dicant, nisi prius id uiderint ratione. Immo nec calcem, nec
diem, nec solem. Ad eundem modum & de uoce, auribus fidem abrogent, &
de odore, naribus, & de omni tangibili, ipsi tactus sensui. Et nonne
haec sunt pyronis hesitatio, & nugae immensae? Sane equum fuerat, eos
qui optimam sectam in philosophia elegissent, quae scilicet calidum,
frigidum, humidum, & siccum principia & elementa statuit, non intantum
desciuisse a uiris qui haec posuerunt, ut quod omnis demonstrationis
principia sunt, quaeque sensui, quaeque intellectui sunt manifesta non
cognoscerent. Et profecto quisquis de his addubitat, frustra de aliis
inquirit. Vtpote ne unde quidem sit incepturus quicquam sibi relinquens.
Vnde igitur in tam diuersam uiam diuerterunt, ac sensibilium rerum
cognitionem ratione consequi tentarunt? Ego ne cogitare quidem possum.
Eoque quod actu calidum est, tactu iudico. Siquid autem adhuc calidum
non est, sed ut tale fiat est idoneum, quod utique potestate calidum
appellamus, id ratione inuestigare conor: hii uero omnia nescio quo pacto
subuertunt, & in argumentis prolixe retoricantur. Sed hos mittamus.
Illius tamen nunc minime obliti quod unum prauorum dogmatum principium
sit, nihil de demonstratione prius meditatum simul res ipsas inquirere,
simul ueluti scientem quidnam demonstratio sit, demonstrare tentare.
Denuo igitur ad propositum reuersi, calidum quod in aetatibus cognoscere
cupimus, primum & maxime, tactu iudicemus. Erit autem optimum iudicium
in uno, eodemque unius infantis corpore, potest enim & qualis calor illi
ante biennium fuerit, in memoria reponi. Et qualis nunc sit post duos
forte uel tris interpositos annos. Si nanque mutatio omnino ulla ad
calidum, frigidum ue infanti facta uidebitur, nullum praeterea negotium
erit, qui usque ad florentem aetatem futurus excessus sit colligere. Quod
si plures puellos pluribus conferre florentibus aetate uelis, graciles
gracilibus, quadratos quadratis, & crassa crassis conferes, aeque uero &
qui colore, & reliquis omnibus (quoad fieri potest) similiter se habeant.
Quippe si differentiam in aetatibus inuenire studeas, in similibus
quam maxime licet naturis, eam inquisitionem tutius facies. Porro in
contrariis naturis hanc disquirere non parui erroris est occasio.
Cum interim non tam exploratorum corporum aetatis, quam naturalis
temperamenti gratia differentia existat. Ad eundem modum, tum uictu
uniuerso tum temporum, quibus exploratur statu, pari modo se habentia
corpora eliges, non exercitatum, requieto comparans, non balneo usum,
ei qui eo non sit usus, non ieiunium, saturo, non sicientem, ebrio: non
eum qui sole incaluit, ei qui ex frigore riget, non eum qui uigilauit,
ei qui dormiuit, nec denique eos quibus contraria est uel natura, uel
uictus ratio, uel quaelibet rerum circunstantia. Sed reliqua omnia sint
quam fieri licet paria, una aetate excepta: pari modo si unum eundemque
puellum cum seipso conferes, omnes eius externas circunstantias similes
ad unguem seruabis: quo scilicet, si qua harum alicuius causa in calore
& frigore differentia contigit, aetatis mutationi non imputetur. Longam
tibi experiendi rationem fortasse tradere uideor. Sed plane uerissimam,
atque ex ipsa rei quaesitae essentia desumptam. Sicut in his, quae
de demonstratione scripsimus, a nobis est proditum. Tu uero fortasse
compendiariam uoles minime curans, si falsa sit. Scito ergo non solum
falsam te, sed etiam longam ingressurum uiam. Neque tribus, quatuor ue
annis, quod requiris, inuenturum, sed tota uita in ignorantia uersandum.
Quantum enim accipi ex memoratorum uirorum controuersia licet, non
est, quod putemus clare aliquid demonstrari posse. Sed nec rationabile
omnino est, ex iis quae posteriora sint, ea probari quae sunt priora.
Ergo calidum, frigidumque corpus quod saltem actu, nec adhuc potestate
tale sit, sensu iudicemus, misso nunc tum priorum iudicio tum reliquis
omnibus notis. Et te iam ceu recte iudicaturum, ad ipsam experientiam
remitto. Meum autem iudicium ipse interpretabor. Complura enim deinceps
corpora, non puerorum modo uerum etiam infantium, adolescentium, &
aetate florentium, curiose tangens, neutros uera locutos inueni, nec
eos qui absoluto sermone calidiorem, nec eos qui frigidiorem esse
florentem etatem, quam puerilem dixerunt. Si enim reliquis omnibus quae
extrinsecus adueniunt alterationibus circumcisis, eas quae ex sola
aetate proueniunt, differentias estimaueris, neuter absolute loquenti
uidebitur tibi calidior. Quippe dissident eorum calores qualitate, quae
ex imparitate difflatus creatur. Cuius rei occasione nonnulli uel eos,
qui secum uersentur, uel seipsos fallentes, alii puerorum, alii iuuenum,
ualentiorem esse calorem autumant. Est enim puerorum, calor magis
halituosus, & copiosus, & tangenti blandior, florentium calor subacre
quiddam habet, ac non suaue. Haec igitur tangenti occursus differentia,
plures inducit, ut florentium corpus calidius esse pronuncient. Res uero
aliter se habet. Quippe qui in uaria materia tactum suum ad calorem,
tum ualentiorem, tum imbecilliorem, tum parem discernendum exercuerit,
huic non dubito puerorum calorem, florentium calori, uel parem uel
ampliorem uisum iri. Est porro exercendi ratio haec. Incipiendum enim
ab eo quod euidens maxime est. Balinearum aer ita est aliquando calens,
ut nemo eum ferat. Sed uri in eo uersatus uideatur. Aliquando ita est
frigidus, ut sudare in eo non sit. Iam tertium quoque & ab his diuersum,
quem utique maxime requirimus, temperatum aeris statum, quid refert
dicere? Idem tres caloris status, in solii quoque apparent aqua. Quippe
quae & calida adeo ut urat, & frigida adeo, ut ne calefaciat quidem, &
temperata adeo, ut calefaciat modice, saepe cernitur. Ergo si te uter sit
calidior perconter, aqua ne temperata, an aer temperatus, neutrum dicere
possis. Cum enim ambo similiter corpori blanda sint, & mediocri aeri
temperie, alterum eorum dicere calidius esse, alterum frigidius, nulla
dici ratione uidetur. Iam si intelligas aquam labri, ea esse caliditate
ut ferueat, aut aerem balnei prorsus inflammatum, ab utroque te pari modo
deurendum constat. Rursus si aquam ita intelliges frigidam, ut procul a
glaciando non absit, aut aerem prorsus refrigeratum, sic ut cum ningit,
conspicitur, patet, quod utriusuis occursu pari modo refrigeraberis,
rigebisque. Ergo summum tum calorem, tum frigus similiter in aqua,
similiterque in aere finge praeterea medium amborum extremorum statum,
simili modo in utroque constitue, hoc casu quod in medio interuallo
extremorum, & medii status tum in aere est, tum aqua, easdem excessus
distantiaeque rationes habebit. Tantoque dices alterum mediocri esse
calidius, quanto alterum. Ad eundem modum & frigidius quam mediocre,
tanto esse aquam aliquando dices, quanto & aerem. Tametsi suus utriusque
occursus tangenti, idem non sit utrique. Neque enim simili modo aqua
temperata sicut aer temperatus tactum afficit. Et quid opus est in tam
dissimilibus exemplum proponam. Cum ipse aer qui simili sit calore,
uarie tangenti occurrat, prout alias ueluti caliginosus & halituosus,
alias ueluti fuliginosus & fumosus: interim purus omnino est. Igitur in
pluribus iisdemque differentibus aequalitas caloris consistit. Quae in
consyderatis quasi inequalis sit, imponit, propterea scilicet quod non
undequaque similis apparet. Caeterum homo, qui rationes, quas proposui
expenderit, & sensum in multa particularium experientia exercuerit, is
nimirum aequalitatem caloris in pueris florentibusque inueniet, nec eo
falletur, quod alter in humida, alter in sicca substantia representetur.
Quippe lapis aliquando pari cum aqua calore esse potest, nullum eo
faciente discrimen, quod lapis siccus sit, aqua humida. Ita igitur
mihi cum pueros iuuenes adolescentes millies consyderassem, praeterea
eundem infantem, puerum, adolescentemque factum nihilo calidior uisus
est. Nec puer quam aetate florens, nec aetate florens quam puer. Sed
tantum quemadmodum dixi in pueris magis halituosus, & multus, & suauis:
in florentibus exiguus, siccus, nec similiter suauis esse caloris
occursus. Siquidem puerorum substantiae, utpote humidae, multum foras
effluit, florentium substantiae parum utpote siccae. Itaque neuter eorum
simpliciter uidetur calidior. Sed alter multitudine eius quod difflatur:
alter acrimonia. Quippe insiti caloris puer plus habet, eiusque
blandioris, si modo ex sanguine & semine ortum habet. In florentibus
aetate, exiguus & siccus, nec similiter suauis calor tangenti occurrit.
Ergo calidi, frigidique corporis solus tactus est iudex: humidi autem &
sicci una cum tactu, ratio. Quippe quod siccum est, durum prorsus est. At
hoc tactu omnino dignoscitur. Non tamen si quid durum est, idem statim &
siccum est. Etenim inseparabilis a sicco corpore duritia est. Non tamen
eius unius propria. Nam & quod a frigore concretum est, durum cernitur
sicut glaties. Quo utique minus sicci, humidique adeunda statim discretio
est, ante scilicet quam estimatum sit, quemadmodum se in calore habeant
& frigore. Neque enim siquid cum summo frigore representatur durum, id
etiam siccum est. Nec si quid cum uehementi calore est molle, idem statim
est humidum. Verum cum mediocriter est calidum, tum estimare durum ne
an molle sit oportet. Si enim molle sit, humidum est: si durum, siccum.
Verum si haec ita se habent partium, quae in humano corpore sunt durae,
nulla est humida. Neque enim tanta esse in eo frigiditas potest, ut
aliquid in ipso concrescere in duriciem queat. Potest enim quod prius
fuit fluxile, aliquando concrescere ueluti adeps. Quod enim oleosum in
sanguine, fluxileque & pingue est, ubi in frigidum uenit locum, cogitur:
durum tamen ne sic quidem efficitur. Commode igitur dictum ueteribus est,
humidissimam esse adipem. Secundo post eam loco carnosum genus. Eius
plures sunt species, prima quidem quae proprie caro appellatur, quam
scilicet nusquam in corpore per se inuenies, sed est perpetuo musculi
pars. Ab hac cuiusque uiscerum propria substantia est. Eam Erasistratus
parenchyma uocat. Quasique pro re parua, leuique habet, parum intelligens
cuiusque uisceris actionem, huic carni acceptam referri: sed horum non
est nunc tempus. Quod autem ipsum cerebri pulmonisque proprium corpus
proximum adipi humiditatis ratione sit, ex mollicie eius coniectare licet.
Non enim a frigido congelatur, cum nec calore fundatur, propinquam iis
naturam habet ossium medulla. Non est tamen eiusdem generis cum cerebro &
spinali medulla, ea quae in quolibet habetur osse. Sed cerebrum & spinae
medulla eiusdem sunt generis. Reliquae omnes medullae alterius naturae
sunt. Est tamen humidius ac calidius cerebrum, quam spinalis medulla.
Eoque etiam mollius, praeterea ipsius cerebri priores partes tanto sunt
humidiores, quanto molliores: omnia tamen haec cute non humidiora modo
sunt, sed etiam frigidiora, unoque uerbo omne exangue frigidius sanguine
praedito est. Proxima cuti est mollium neruorum natura. Duriores autem in
humido & sicco, secundum cutis naturam se habent. Calore ab eius natura
tantum absunt, quantum consentiens est exangue corpus a sanguine praedito
abesse: lienis autem renum, & iecinoris caro, tanto cute est humidior,
quanto est mollior. Calidior autem quanto magis abundat sanguine. Iam
cordis caro omnibus hiis tanto est siccior, quanto est durior. Calidior
uero non modo his, sed etiam omnibus plane corporis particulis. Quod
etiam sensu clare deprehendas licet, in pectoris animalis dissectione,
si digitum in sinistrum eius sinum immiseris. Inuenies enim locum hunc
omnium, quae in animali sunt non paulo calidissimum. At iecinoris,
lienis, renum, & pulmonis caro, simplicis cuiusdam naturae est, circa
cuiusque uisceris uenas, arterias, & neruos crescens. Cordis, simplex
carnis natura non est: sed sunt in eo fibrae, quales in musculis
cernimus, quibus caro circumheret. Caeterum non est idem fibrarum genus,
sed quae in musculis habentur neruorum, & ligamentorum sunt particulae.
Cordis propria quaedam fibrarum est species, aeque scilicet ut uenarum,
tunicae, atque arteriarum. Itemque intestinorum, uentriculi uteri,
& uesicae utriusque, licet enim in his quoque instrumentis propriam
quandam uidere carnem, suis ipsorum fibris circumnascentem. Atque hae
quidem carnes, cute sunt calidiores: fibrae uero quam cutis partim paulo
magis, partim paulo minus, tum frigidae, tum siccae sunt, partim similes
omnino cutis substantiae. Porro omnes membranae cute sunt sicciores,
ueluti cerebri, & spinalis medullae inuolucra, quae mininges dicuntur.
Sunt enim hae quoque membranae. Iam ligamenta omnia quanto cute sunt
duriora, tanto sunt & sicciora. Tendones quoque tametsi ligamentis sunt
molliores, at tamen cute luculenter sunt duriores. Cartilago uero post
ligamentum deinceps est, praeterea medium quoddam inter ea corpus.
Appellant id anatomici quidam νευροχονδρώδη σύνδεσμον, quasi uero
cartilagineum ligamentum dicas. Est autem id durum, cartilaginosumque
ligamentum. Os uero omnium quae cutis operit, durissimum est. At eorum
quae ex cute extant siccissimus est pilus. Deinde cornu mox ungues, &
ungulae, & calcaria, & rostra, quaeque his in singulis animalium ratione
carentium similes sunt partes. Succorum optimus, & maxime proprius, ac
domesticus sanguis est, huius ueluti sedimentum, ac fex, atra bilis
est. Quae idcirco tum frigidior, tum crassior sanguine est. Sicut flaua
bilis longe calidior, frigidissimum uero ac humidissimum omnium, quae in
animali habentur, pituita est. Instrumentum autem quo id cognoscitur,
ipse est tactus. Veluti Hyppocrates in libello de hominis natura
monstrauit. Caeterum quod frigida sit, unus tactus discernit. Quod uero
humida quoque, pariter tactus, uisus, & ratio iudicant. Et tactus quidem
ac uisus, quod talis iis cernitur. Ratio uero, ubi non caloris copia,
sed naturali humorem talem esse definiuit. Ac particulae quidem & succi
corporis, adhunc modum se habent. De iis, quae temperamenta comitantur
deinceps agendum. Comitantur enim ea & quae dicta iam sunt: immo potius
inseparabilia omnino sunt. A sicco quidem corpore duritia, ab humido
mollicies. Si tamen cum tepido calore est: sed & crassitudo habitus, &
gracilitas, temperamenta sequuntur. Non ea modo quae naturalia sunt,
sed etiam si qua ex longa consuetudine sunt contracta. Multos siquidem
qui natura graciles fuerant, pingues redditos uidi, contraque qui
pingues fuerant, graciles. Illis quidem ex otiosa & delicata uita, toto
temperamento ad humidius mutato. His uero multa tollerantia, & curis,
& tenui uictu persiccatis. Dicemus uero & horum discernendorum notas.
Satius enim est talis ne quispiam natura sit, an ex consuetudine redditus
nosmet per aliquot signa discernere posse, quam ab alio id quaerere.
Sane eiusmodi signorum autor, aeque ut reliquorum omnium, mirus est
Hyppocrates. Siquidem quibuscunque latiores uenae sunt, hi calidiores
natura sunt. Quibus angustiores, contra magis frigidi. Caloris nanque
opus est has dilatare, flatuque extendere. Ita rationabiliter in idem
fere recidit uenarum angustia, cum habitu pingui, & crassiore, habitus
gracilis cum uenarum laxitate. Quod si quis simul pinguis, crassusque
est, ac uenas laxas habet, is consuetudinis alicuius occasione non
natura pinguis est redditus. Sicut ediuerso, si quis angustas habet
uenas, & gracilis est, ne hunc quidem talem esse natura necesse est.
Quin cum fames urget mediocritatem ex laxitate uenarum, & angustia,
non a caetero totius corporis habitu spectandam esse ait. Quippe qui
angustas habent uenas, exigui sunt sanguinis, nec longam inediam ferunt.
Quibus latae, his copia sanguinis est, & citra noxam cibo abstinentur.
Causae horum euidentes iam sunt, iis qui animum aduerterint, tametsi a
me non referantur. Sed quoniam non omnes aduertunt, necessum fortasse
erit aliquid eorum causa dixisse. Quicquid in sanguine pingue, leue, &
tenue est, id in calidioribus corporibus alimentum quoddam calido fit.
In frigidioribus seruatur. Cunque id uenae extra se transmiserint ubi in
frigidas particulas incidit, quod genus membranae sunt in iis concrescit.
In partibus uero natura calidioribus, cuiusmodi carnosae sunt, a calore
ipso absumitur, ac digeritur. Nisi sicubi frigiditati temperamenti etiam
vita indulgentior accedens, ipsis carnosis particulis adipis aliquid
allinat. Qua ratione etiam quae hieme delitescunt animalia, non raro
inueniuntur adipe obesa. Et foeminae uiris sunt pinguiores. Quod scilicet
foemina mari est frigidior & plurimum domi uersatur. Ac quicunque
corporum habitus & temperamenti natura sunt & mediocri exercitatione
utuntur, hos necesse est eusarcos esse, id uero est mediocri omnino
corporis habitu. Quibus uero humidum abundat, & calor a mediocritate
summa non longe abest, hi corpulenti, siue carnosi fiunt. Corpulenti
rursus fiunt, qui natura sunt temperati. Caeterum desides & otiosi
uiuunt. Quippe dictum a ueteribus commodissime est, consuetudinem
acquisititiam esse naturam. Nec fortasse oportebit cum id iam semel
dixerimus, in quouis etiam capite definire natura ne frigidior, an ex
consuetudine quispiam sit redditus. Sed illud legentibus remittere. Me
autem compendii causa proprios cuique temperamento corporis habitus
persequi. Sunt igitur nonnulli qui & graciles sint, & uenas paruas
habeant. Sed si ex iis quempiam incidas, adeps excidet. Quam constat
cuti, ad internam eius membranam subnasci. Et raro id quidem in
uiris conspicitur: in foeminis saepissime inuenitur. Est nanque tum
frigidioris naturae, tum uitae magis desidiosae eiusmodi nota. Si
quidem adeps ex habitus frigiditate gignitur. Corpulentia, siue carnis
abundantia ex sanguinis copia nascitur. Mediocritas temperatae naturae
est nota. Et corpulenti quidem, omnino plus adipis habent quam temperati.
Nec tamen pro carnis semper portione adeps simul augetur. Sed alios
habere plus carnis, alios plus adipis uideas, aliis ambo pari modo sunt
adaucta. Et quibus quidem ambo pari modo sunt aucta, his tantum supra
temperatam naturam humoris est, quantum & frigoris. Quibus autem plus est
adipis, in his frigidi plus est, quam humidi. Eque ut quibus caro est
plenior, his humoris plus iusto est. Non tamen etiam frigoris. Cum enim
calori intra debitos fines manenti, boni sanguinis accedit copia, necesse
est corpulentia sequatur. Quantum autem supra mediocritatem esse sanguis
debeat, id quidem mensura & pondere, ostendere non est. Ratione tradere
licet. Quippe ubi nullum adhuc morbosum symptoma, crassato corpori
incidit, humoris abundantia intra sanitatis interim est fines. Monstratum
enim nobis & in aliis est, non paruam in eo statu, quae sanitas dicitur,
necessario statuendam esse latitudinem. Quin nunc quoque in omni fere
sermone nostro apparet. Qui temperatam, mediamque naturam, reliquarum
ueluti canonem semper statuamus. Quae uero ex huius utraque sunt parte,
intemperatas censeamus. Quod utique non faceremus, nisi in sanitatis
statu, maioris, minorisque ratio inueniretur. Est enim alia sanitatis,
alia morbi intemperies. Morbi quidem ea quae a media temperie longissime
abest. Sanitatis quae paulum. definire autem modum ne hic quidem mensura,
& pondere licet. Caeterum intemperamenti, quod intra sanitatem habetur
sufficiens nota est: quod nulla functio animalis manifeste sit adhuc
laesa. Quantum igitur interuallum est inter id, quod perfectissime
functionem obit, & id quod manifeste actionem aliquam habet oblaesam,
tanta est profecto & sanitatis, & distemperantiae, quae intra sanitatem
consistit latitudo. Ab hac proxima est intemperies morbosa, cum scilicet
animal intemperamenti uitio aegrotat. Non enim huius tantum noxa laborat:
sed etiam aliis affectibus non paucis, de quibus in iis, quae de morborum
differentiis scribemus, diffusius agetur. Nunc redeundum ad diuerticulum
est. Sicuti enim naturali calore optimam seruante temperiem, humidum
quod intra sanitatis terminos est auctum, non adipem modo in homine, sed
etiam corpulentiam gignit, & adipem quidem partius adiicit, carnem uero
multo liberalius auget. Ita rursus, si humidum & siccum mediocritatem
ad unguem inter se seruent, calor autem in homine sit minor, necesse
est huius corpus adipe, quam carnis copia magis abundet. At uero si
calor augeatur, seruetque mediocritatem altera contrarietas, minus
erit ei animali adipis quam carnis. Sicut ediuerso si quando pollet
siccum, altera contrarietate medium modum seruante, & gracilius &
durius, corpus euadet. Haec a me dicta sunt, patetque non solum ratione
monstratum esse quod simplices in animalium corporibus intemperies
habeantur, sed etiam quod singularum manifeste sint notae. Nec eae modo
in calore, frigore, mollitie, & duritie: sed etiam in reliquis omnibus
habituum corporis differentiis. Quarum de iis, quae ex gracilitate &
crassitudine spectantur mox diximus, de reliquis nunc dicamus. Calida
igitur & sicca intemperies hirsuta est, uerum ea in summo. Mediocriter
autem quae calida quidem est, sed in altera contrarietate mediocritatem
habet. Similiter & quae sicca quidem est, sed in calido & frigido media
est temperie. Est enim ea quoque modice hirta. Nuda pilis sunt frigida
omnia temperamenta, siue ea mediocriter se habent in humiditate, siue
immodice. Caeterum ad summum glabra est frigida temperies & humida.
Minus hac, quae frigida est, sed in altera contrarietate temperata.
Ad huc minus, quae frigida est & sicca. Quanquam putet aliquis sicut
fieri non potest, ut in terra sicca herbae nascantur, nutriantur, &
incrementum capiant, sic nec pili in sicca cute. Est autem secus. Quippe
terra, ut terra sicca dicitur. Cutis, ut cutis: itaque siccitas, quae in
terra est, maxime sine humore est. Quae uero in hominis est corpore,
& eius similium animalium, nec humoris est expers, & maxime omnium ad
pilorum generationem est idonea. Siquidem nec ex iis quae silicea testa
intecta sunt, nec crustatis, ueluti ostreis, locustis, cancris: sed
nec ex iis, quae in cauernis delitescunt, quales sunt serpentes, nec
quae squamata sunt, cuiusmodi sunt pisces, oriri pili possunt. Sunt
enim horum cutes uere, atque in totum siccae ritu testae, uel petrae.
Caeterum ex his, quae molli sunt cute, ut homo, quanto utique siccior
calidiorque cutis fuerit, tanto magis potest pilos gignere. Nam ut ab
exemplo terrae, quod illi proponunt, non recedamus: herbae nec in sicca
& squalente admodum terra nasci possunt, nec in humida & lacustri:
uerum cum absumi ceperit, redundantia humoris, tum enascuntur e terra.
Augentur autem largius, ubi haec quoque siccescit: modice quidem in
uere, celerrime uero & plurimum ineunte aestate. Siccantur autem omnino,
arefacta terra, aestate iam media, licetque tibi (si placet) nunc quoque,
sicuti in priore libro demonstratum est, uer ipsum, propterea quod ex
temporibus anni temperatum est, temperati corporis id assimilare cuti,
potissimumque huius temporis medium. Tum enim terra quoque ipsa, medio
quodam statu humoris, siccitatisque est. Quod autem ueris aestati est
proximum, id iam sicciorem iusto reddidit terram, hoc etiam amplius,
aestas inchoata. Quam igitur dico calidam, & siccam cutem hanc maxime
terrae statui assimiles quae abeunte sit uere, uel ineunte aestate. Nam
media aestate in summo est sicca perinde ut testa intectorum animalium
tegmen non ut hominum, suum, asinorum, equorum, aut alterius cuiusquam
eorum, quae pilis uestiuntur. Quare si cutem terrae comparare uolunt,
hactenus quoque rem consentire cum iis, quae prius diximus inuenient.
Ipsi uero sese ex omonymia non animaduersa fallunt. In sicca enim &
calida cute multos magnosque nasci pilos diximus. Nimirum ut de homine
uel animali pilis praedito, non de ostreis, aut cancris uerba facientes.
Quippe per omnem cutem digeritur semper aliquid a calido, quod secum
etiam interni humoris nonnihil aufert, uerum in quibus humida cutis
est, & plane mollis, qualis modo concrescens caseus, in his eorum quae
exciderunt, uiae per cutem non manent, partibus scilicet eius, quae
prius dissidebant, rursus inter se unitis. At in quibus dura est,
non absimilis caseo iam coacto, perforatur quidem eorum quae exeunt
transfluxu. Cum autem rursus uniri per siccitatem nequeat, meatus ipsos
immutatos seruat. Qui etiam perpetuo transfluentium ictu assidue magis
fistulantur. Si igitur quod transfluit uel halitus uel humor purus
sit, halitui certe celer, minimeque impeditus transitus est, humor
in exilioribus spiramentis nonnunquam haeret. Aliquid etiam intro
recurrere ad profundum cogitur. Sin ueluti fuliginosus, crassusque,
et terreus uapor sit, subinde contingit ut in angustis spiramentis
impactus: nec facile rursum intro redeat, nec uacuari possit. Hunc
igitur alius rursum e profundo subiens ferit, prorsumque impellit, tum
hunc rursus alter, atque illum alius. Ac multos mihi eiusmodi uapores,
fuliginosos alium super alium impactos, tempore complicari, coniungique
intellige, ac unum eiusmodi efficere corpus, quale est ea, quae foris
cernitur fuligo, nisi quod hic quantum spissatum est, tantum etiam per
transitus angustiam stipatum, in angustam prorsus redactum est formam.
Vbi autem tale corpus totum obstruxerit meatum deinceps iam uiolenter
ictum, a similibus sui quibus exitus non est excrementis, totum interim
propellitur. Adeo ut cute exire cogatur, iam lori formam adeptum. Ad
similes autem, quod in meatu est impactum, herbae, stirpis ue ueluti
radici. Quod uero ex cute extat, ipsi ueluti stirpi, fit autem niger
pilus, cum deusto ui caloris uapore, excrementum in exactam fuliginem
mutatur, flauus uero, cum uapor minus torretur. Quippe quod tum est
impactum flauae bilis, non nigrae feculentum excrementum est. Albus
uero pilus ex pituita nascitur. Rufus sicuti coloris flaui albique est
medius, sic eius generatio ex pituitosae, biliosaeque fecis media quadam
natura prouenit. Crispi pili fiunt uel propter siccitatem temperamenti
uel propter meatum, in quo radicantur. Et propter siccitatem quidem,
ad eum modum quo corigiae, quae igni plus iusto siccantur. Et quid
corigiarum meminisse est opus, cum ipsos pilos, ubi igni propius sunt
admoti, protinus intorqueri uideas. Atque ita quidem omnes Aethiopes
sunt crispi. At propter meatuum in quibus radicantur naturam, ad hunc
modum. Cum exhalatio saepe imbecillior est, quam ut rectam uiam sibi
moliri possit, pro modo quo inflectitur, etiam meatum suum figurat.
Interim uero exhalatio satis ualens est. Sed duriore cutis natura,
recta ferri regione prohibita, in latus flectitur: ita ut extrinsecus
uidere licet, non halitum modo, aut fumum, sed etiam flammam ipsam cum
sursum agi uetatur, diuisam utroque uersus in obliquum agi. Sic igitur
corporis exhalatio, ubi prorsum agi prohibetur, obliquum sibi transitum
sub cute molitur. Donec longiore spatio collectam, aliquid eam urgeat, &
foras flatu agat. Est quando ambobus coeuntibus, & prima exhalationis,
quae meatum finxit imbecillitate, & cutis siccitate, obliquitas pilorum
radicibus contingit. Quales autem in radice finguntur, tales rationabile
est perpetuo fore. Neque enim durorum & siccorum corporum quippiam, nisi
prius molliatur, fingi in rectum potest. Atque haec quidem est pilorum
generatio. Sequens est, ut causas omnium, quae temperamentis in pilorum
pro aetate regione, & corporis natura differentiis contingunt, dicamus.
Ergo Aegyptii, Arabes, & Indi, omnes denique qui calidam & siccam
regionem incolunt, nigros, exiguique incrementi, siccos, crispos, &
fragiles pilos habent. Contra qui humidam, frigidamque regionem habitant,
Illyrii, Germani, Sarmatae, & omnis Scytica plaga, modice auctiles, &
graciles, & rectos, & rufos optinent. Qui uero inter hos temperatum
colunt tractum, hi pilos plurimi incrementi, & robustissimos, & modice
nigros, & mediocriter crassos, tum nec prorsus crispos, nec omnino rectos
edunt. Et in aetatibus ad eundem modum infantium quidem pili Germanis
Florentium aetate, Aethiopibus, Epheborum, & puerorum, iis qui temperatum
locum incolunt, in robore, crassitudine, magnitudine, & colore, ad
portionem se habent. In corporum quoque naturis ad aetatum, & regionum
portionem pili se habent. Pueri enim admodum parui nudi sunt pilis.
Quod utique nec meatus adhuc ullus illis in cute est: nec fuliginosum
excrementum. Incipientes autem pubescere, paruos, & imbecillos exigunt.
At qui iam florent ualentiores, & multos & magnos, & nigros habent. Quod
& frequentes iam meatus iis sint facti. Et fuliginosis excrementis, prae
siccitate, & calore abundent. Caeterum pili, qui in capite superciliis, &
ciliis habentur, etiam pueris nobis innascuntur. Siquidem generatio iis
est, non qualis herbis, sed qualis stirpibus, prima ratione a natura
conditis, non temperamentum ex necessitate sequentibus. Sicuti in libris
de usu particulatum est monstratum: uerum hi quoque quod quidem sint,
id naturae arti acceptum ferunt. Quod nigri, rufi ue, uel alio quouis
sint colore, id aetatis temperamento omnino debent. Subrufi enim fere
sunt, quoniam quod in meatibus est impactum, nondum totum est nigrum.
Quippe cum humiditas multa sit, & transitus facilis & deustio imbecilla.
Boni uero incrementi, & modice crassi sunt, propter excrementorum
quibus aluntur, copiam. Quippe ipsa pars corporis in qua fiunt, sicca
est. Tota nanque calua ossea est. Cutis uero, quae illi est circundata,
tanto reliqua totius corporis cute est siccior, quanto etiam est durior.
Ascendit tamen tum ab iis, quae circa cerebrum sunt, tum uero ex toto
corpore, fuliginosi excrementi non parua uis. Quo fit, ut quale, aetate
florentibus, totum est corpus, eiusmodi iam infantibus sit capitis
cutis. Eoque rationabilius nonnulli procedente tempore calui redduntur.
Quibus scilicet a primo durior cutis erat. Quippe monstratum prius est
senescentium partes omnes siccescere. Fit autem cutis non paucis ueluti
testacea, ubi supra iustum fuerit siccata. In ea uero sicut ex prioribus
constat nihil nasci potest. Itaque etiam interna manuum, & inferna pedum,
semper glabra, & pilorum expertia sunt, quod siccissimus, densissimusque
sit tendo is, qui sub cute habetur. Quibus autem ad summam siccitatem,
cutis capitis non peruenit, imbecilli his omnino, albique pili fiunt,
quos uulgo, canos appellant. Imbecilli quidem, conuenientis alimenti
penuria, albi uero propterea quod alimentum quo aluntur, ueluti situs
est pituitae, quae spatio computruit. Vbi enim meatus etiamnum manet,
excrementum uero exiguum est, & lentum, ac languide a calore propellitur,
non dissimiliter putredini afficitur, iam calui fiunt homines, cum
senescunt, a sincipite magis. Canescunt magis a temporibus, quoniam
illud omnium capitis partium est siccissimum. Haeret enim cutis illic
ossi nudo, tempora uero humidiora sunt. Quod in his musculi magni sub
cute habeantur. Omnis autem musculus carnosus sit. Caro, tum osse, tum
cute humidior. Est autem ei quod dicimus diligenter attendendum, ne
imprudentes nosmetipsos fallamus. Sicuti se fallunt multi ex iis, qui
optimi uisi sunt medici. Qui si quem caluum uiderint, statim huic siccum
esse totius corporis temperamentum putant. Neque enim simpliciter ita
coniectari oportebat. Sed prius illud definire praestiterat, humanum
corpus in aliis aequabili per totum temperamento esse, in aliis, nec
iis paucis inequabiliter esse affectum. Cum eorum aliae particulae
mediocri & iusto sint humidiores: aliae frigidiores, aliae sicciores,
aliae calidiores, aliae prorsus temperatae, ac mediocres. Porro huic
maxime esse attentos conuenit, ubi corporis temperiem estimamus. Quippe
si totum corpus aequabiliter conditum sit, omnemque partium inter se
competentiam in latitudine, longitudine, & altitudine seruet: potest
utique aequabiliter attemperatum esse id corpus. At si cui corpori Thorax
collum, & humeri maximi sunt, lumbi parui, angustique, & crura gracilia
atque sicca, quomodo id dixeris omnibus particulis similiter affectum?
Quin si crura ei crassa sint, & lumbi lati. Thorax uero angustus, ne id
quidem omnibus partibus equabiliter est temperatum. Sunt alia corpora,
quibus maximum est caput: alia quibus paruum, quale passeribus. Iam crura
aliis blesa, aliis vara. Artuum quoque extrema aliis gracilia sunt, aliis
crassa. Et thorax aliis ut dictum est, latus aliis tabulae ritu angustus,
quos Graeci σανιδώδεις uocant. Vbi uero opertae scoptulae illis, siue
carne nudaeque plane sunt & alarum more pronae, nominantur a medicis
eiusmodi naturae Graece πτερυγώδεις. Quantopere autem hae sint uiciatae
deperdito his paulo minus omni interno spatio, quo pulmo, & cor sunt
sita, neminem latet. Innumerae uero aliae particularum corporis plane
affectiones sunt. Vbi id a naturali analogia, protinus in utero matris ad
inaequalem intemperiem est mutatum. Minime igitur in corporibus id genus,
ex unica particula coniectandum de toto est. Neque enim hi qui mores ex
ingenio corporis docere profitentur, simpliciter de omnibus pronunciant.
Verum ipsi quoque experientia docti, si quis impense hirto est pectore.
Hunc audacem iudicant, sin cruribus est hirtis, salacem. Non tamen causam
etiam adiiciunt: neque enim cum pectus habere leoni simile dicunt. Crura
uero hirco, iam primam causam inuenerunt. Siquidem cur leo quidem audax,
hircus uero salax sit, ratio etiam inuestigandum exigit, hactenus enim
quod in re fieri cernitur dixere. Causam tamen eius omisere. Caeterum
is, qui naturali speculatione est exercitatus, sicuti aliorum omnium,
ita horum quoque causas inuenire tentat. Propterea enim quod inequali
partium temperamento sunt, non leo modo & hircus, sed etiam caeterorum
pleraque animalium, idcirco ad alias actiones aliud est pronum. Ac de
his quidem Aristoteles commode tractauit. Sed quod ad re propositam est
utile, id iam apparet. Hominum scilicet temperamenta consyderantibus,
singulas partium per se examinandas esse. Nec si cui thorax hirsutus
est, huic totum corpus calidius, sicciusque ex necessitate putandum. Sed
plurimum in corde caloris esse. Eoque audacem: posse uero aliquando etiam
huius ipsius rei occasione accidere, quo minus totum his corpus similiter
calidum siccumque sit: quod scilicet plurimum caloris sursum huc
spirauerit, atque in ambientem abierit. Nam si tota corporis temperies
est aequalis erit his statim thorax ipse uniuersus latissimus, uenae
amplae, arteriae magnae, eaedem maxime, uehementissimeque pulsantes,
tum plurimi per totum corpus pili. Atque hi quidem in capite plurimi
incrementi, nigri, & crispi. Vtique in prima aetate procedente uero
tempore caluities excipiet. Quin etiam eiusmodi hominibus cum aequaliter
sunt attemperati, & robustum, & exacte deliniatum, & musculosum totum
corpus erit. Tum cutis nigrior, durior, atque hirsutior. Ad eundem
modum, si contraria omnia in thorace sint, ac aequalis in toto corpore
temperies uigeat, id est, si humidiores & frigidiores uniuersae corporis
partes sint, thorax quidem angustus, & glaber erit. Sicuti etiam
totum corpus pilis nudum. Cutis uero mollis & alba, capilli subrufi,
potissimum in iuuentute, hi in senectute non caluescunt, timidique statim
& ignaui, & segnes, adde etiam paruis uenis, ac minime conspicuis, &
adiposi fiunt. Iidem neruis, musculisque imbecillis, & artubus, parum
exacte deliniatis, & blesis. At ubi uaria partium temperies est, ex
una earum pronunciare de toto corpore non licet, sed adeundae singulae
sunt: estimandumque, quo temperamento uentriculus, quo pulmo, quo
cerebrum, ac reliquarum per se unaqueque seorsum sit. Atque haec quidem
ex functionibus noscenda. Cum nec manuum contrectatione, nec oculorum
inspectione inuenisse temperiem eorum sit. Simul autem pensitandus, &
continentium ea partium affectus est, quarum omnium extrema est cutis.
Haec in nostra regione, quae utique temperata est subiectarum partium
naturam prodit. Quanquam nec in ea simpliciter loquenti omnium. Sed
duntaxat earum, quae similem habent cuti temperiem. At in his quae sub
ursa & sub meridie sunt locis, quoniam corporum quae in altero sunt,
calor in altum a circundante extrinsecus & uincente frigore est fugatus.
Alterorum in cutem, ab externo calore attractus prodiit, non potest ex
eo affectu, qui in cute cernitur, internarum particularum temperies
clare discerni. Quippe corporis temperies in regionibus, iis quae a
temperie recesserunt, inequalis uisitur, externis scilicet, internisque
partibus ad eundem se modum non habentibus. Gallis enim & Germanis, &
omni Thracio, ac Scithico generi frigida, humidaque cutis est. Ideoque
etiam mollis, alba, & pilis nuda. Omnis uero naturalis his calor in
uiscera una cum sanguine confugit, ubi dum agitatur, & premitur & feruet,
iracundi, audaces, & praecipitis consilii redduntur. Ethiopibus uero &
Arabibus, omnibus denique iis, qui ad meridiem incolunt, natura cutis
ex ambientis aestu & naturali calore foras acto, usta, dura, sicca, &
nigra redditur. Toto corpore naturalis quidem caloris exiguam optinente
portionem. Sed alieno, atque adscito incalescente. Quippe id quoque
ab Aristotele in multis est traditum. Estque illi, si alteri ulli
attendendum, ac in singulis corporibus estimandum suo ne & proprio,
an ascititio calore incaleant. Quae enim putrescunt, omnia adscititio
calore sunt calida, proprio frigent. Qui meridianam plagam incolunt
adscititio calore sunt calidi, proprio frigidi. Iam apud nos quoque
naturalis calor hieme est uberior, adscititius minor. Aestate contra
adscititius maior, naturalis minor. Omnia nanque haec definiat oportet,
qui recte temperamentum est cogniturus. Neque enim omnino si cutis
nigrior apparet, iam totus homo calidior est. Sed si ita est, caeteris
omnibus simili modo se habentibus. Siquidem si alter in sole uersatus
diutius est. Alter in umbra, illi nigrior, huic albidior cutis erit.
Verum hoc ad totius temperamenti alterationem nihil facit. Ipsa nanque
cutis sub sole diutius habita siccior, in umbra, humidior euadet. Non
tamen naturalis temperies, uel iocinoris, uel cordis, uel alterius
cuiusquam uisceris, statim mutabitur. Optimum igitur fuerit, sicuti prius
est dictum, cuiusque seorsum particulae temperamenti notas comparasse.
Verbi gratia uentriculi, si is bene concoquit quod temperatus sit. Sin
non bene concoquit, intemperatus, si nidorosos, uel fumosos edit ructus,
quod igneus in eo calor sit. Sin acidos, imbecillus & infirmus. Simili
modo, si qui bubulam, & omnia quae concoctu difficilia sunt: concoquunt,
quod eorum calor immodicus sit. Si qui haec concoquere non ualent,
sed saxatiles pisces, & talia concoquunt, infirmus. Videndum autem
hic rursum, num succi alicuius, qui aliunde confluat, culpa eiusmodi
symptoma uentriculo accidat. Aliis enim ex capite pituita, aliis flaua
ex iecinore bilis, in uentriculum confluit. Rarum tamen hoc cernitur &
paucissimis contingere. At compluribus a capite defluit pituita. Atque
id maxime Romae, ac locis perinde humidis. Caeterum & quod raro accidit
consyderandum. Nihilque pro superfluo habendum, aut negligendum. Siquidem
ipse uidi, quibusdam perquam pituitosis hominibus, multam tamen in
uentriculo colligi flauam bilem, quam cum ante cibum aqua uino ue epoto,
euomere debuissent, si quid ciborum priusquam uomerent, gustassent, &
hos corrumperent, & capite dolerent. Cum hos quidam natura biliosos esse
crederent. Quanquam essent toto corpore molles, & candidi, & glabri,
& adiposi, & uenis, ac musculis parum conspicuis, praeterea exangues,
nec tangentibus admodum calidi. Vidi & qui bilem nunquam uomuerunt, qui
tamen & graciles, & hirsuti, & musculosi, & nigri, & uenosi fuerunt,
affatimque calidi, si quis tangeret, uidebantur. Cuiusmodi habitu Eudemus
philosophus erat. Sed incidit hoc loco speculatio quaedam anatomica
id est, quae ad corporum dissectionem pertinet, quam aliqui medicorum,
ignorantes, ex symptomatum dissonantia, magnopere anguntur, dum parum
intelligunt meatum illum, per quem iecur bilem in uentriculum euomit,
aliis geminum esse, aliis unicum, id quod in quadrupedum dissectionibus
uidere licet. Ac plurimum quidem unicus is est, in id intestinum quod
pylori, id est, exitus fundi uentris, & ieiuni medium est, insertus.
Graeci medium id γαστρὸς ἔκφυσιν, quasi quiddam e uentre enatum uocant.
Vel si geminus meatus sit, in ecphysin illam maior inseritur, minor
in fundum uentriculi paulo supra pyloron. Inuenitur, sed tamen in
paucissimis, superior pars maior, inferior minor. Caeterum quibus est
maior, his in uentrem quotidie non exiguum bilis effunditur. Quam &
euomant ante cibos oportet, & nisi id faciant, laeduntur. Quibus autem
unicus est omnino meatus, his tota bilis confluit in ieiunum. Quanam
igitur ratione dignoscere hos licebit? Neque enim dissecandos esse uiuos
censeo, primum certe totius corporis temperamento, ueluti paulo supra
est propositum. Deinde iis quae infra excernuntur. Eudemus enim biliosa
mera, perpetuo per sedem excernebat: utpote, qui multam collegit bilem,
cuius nihil in superiorem uentrem peruenit. Reliquis, qui scilicet &
pituitoso erant corporis habitu, & bilem uomebant, his haudquaquam
erat aluus biliosa. Quippe cum & minimum flauae bilis gignerent, & eius
plurima portio in superiorem uentrem perueniret. Tertium notae genus in
ipsis est uacuatis. Nam quibus in uentre biliosum excrementum gignitur,
id porri uirorem praefert. At quibus ex iocinore descendit, his uel plane
flauum est, uel omnino saltem pallidum. Praeterea quibus in uentriculo
bilis illa gignitur, quae porri colorem imitatur, debet omnino his cibus
fuisse, non panis, non suilla caro, simile ue aliquid, sed necessario
aliquid, quod his calidius fuit, neque id boni succi. Quibus autem
ex iocinore in uentrem defluxit, his flaua ea, pallida ue euomitur,
etiam si boni imprimis succi fuit, quod sumpserunt. Etiam si ad summum
fuit concoctum. Imo uero magis ipsis qui ad unguem concoxerunt, flaua
uomuntur. Atque etiam magis his qui diutius cibo abstinuerunt. Quae uero
bilis porrum refert, iis solis gignitur in uentre, qui utique concoxerunt
male. Quin etiam sollicitudo, ira, dolor, labor, exercitatio, uigilia,
abstinentia, & inedia, succi flauae bilis plus aceruant. Propterea quod
plus eius succi in iocinore gignunt. Sunt igitur tum haec certa indicia,
tum ad haec, quod ubi siccum & igneum uentricoli calorem, conuersio
ad biliosum sequitur, panis, & suilla, & bubula caro, commodius quam
saxatiles pisces concoquentur. Cum si ex iecinore bilis affluat, ex
comestorum mutatione nulla secutura sit concoctionis diuersitas. Atque
his quidem discernitur, quod non temperamenti, sed alterius cuiusquam
gratia prouenit. Ad eundem modum si defluens a capite in uentrem
pituita acidi ructus causa est, conueniet simili ratione hic quoque a
uentris proprio affectu hanc discernere. Aeque uero & capitis dolores
ex propria ne eius intemperie, an propter uentris aliqua excrementa
incidant discernendi. Iam cerebrum ipsum cuius sit temperamenti, per se
estimare est satius, quam ex corporis totius affectu. Ipsius autem per
se consyderatio, ex canitie, catarris, tussi, distillatione, & saliuae
copia initur. Quippe quae omnia id frigidius, humidiusque esse doceant.
Atque his amplius si ex leui qualibet occasione, in hos deuenit affectus.
At caluities ex siccitate prouenit. Nigrorum autem & frequentium pilorum
prouentus, equalis in cerebro temperamenti nota est. Ergo ad hunc modum
de temperamentis ineunda nobis consyderatio est. Quanque scilicet
particulam seorsum perpendentibus, nec ausis ex una pronunciare de
omnibus. Quod utique nonnulli fecerunt, qui resimos, humidos, aduncos,
siccos esse dixerunt. Et quibus parui sunt oculi siccos. Quibus magni
humidos. Atque de hoc quidem parum inter eos conuenit. Alii nanque
eorum, qui scilicet humidis particulis oculos adnumerant, ubi eos maiores
uident, in iis humiditatem temperamenti pollere existimant. Alii caloris
uehementia, qui in prima formatione sursum confertim magis copiosiorque
ferebatur, non oculos modo, uerum etiam os ipsum et reliquos omnes
meatus ampliores factos aiunt, ita non humiditatis id, sed caloris
indicium esse. Verum ambo a ueritate aberrant, uno modo, eoque communi,
quod unius particulae occasione de toto corpore pronunciare sunt ausi.
Altero quod formatricis in natura uirtutis, quae artifex facultas est,
& particulas secundum animi mores effingit, parum meminerunt. De hac
nanque Aristoteles dubitauit: nunquid diuinioris originis sit, atque
a calido, frigido, humido, & sicco, res diuersa, quo mihi minus recte
facere uidentur, qui tam temere de rebus maximis pronunciant, & solis
qualitatibus formandarum partium causam assignant. Rationabile enim est,
haec organa esse, formatorem alium. Sed & citra tam arduas quaestiones,
inuenire licet, sicut ostendimus, humidam, siccam, frigidam, calidamque
temperiem. Errant igitur qui propriis indiciis neglectis, ad ea quae
longe posita sunt, & magnae quaestioni fuerunt, atque ad hunc usque diem
optimis philosophorum dubitata sunt conuertuntur. Neque enim propterea
quod pueri nasis magis sunt resimis, florentes aetate magis aduncis,
idcirco rationabile est resimos omnes humidos censere, aduncos siccos.
Sed fieri potest, ut formatricis uirtutis eiusmodi opus sit, potius quam
temperamenti. Quod si temperamenti est nota, at certe eius quod in
naso tantum habetur, non eius quod in toto corpore nota fuerit. Quare
frustra illud praedicant, in siccis natura temperamentis nasum acutum,
oculos cauos, tempora collapsa. Quod scilicet in affectibus iis, quae
corpora liquant, atque supra quam par est, inaniunt, haec contingant.
Saepe nanque sic accidit: sepe non ita. Sed uidere licet totius corporis
habitum, & mollem, & pinguem, & album, & carnosum, cum tamen oculi sunt
parui, & nasus acutus. Rursus siccum, macilentum, nigrum, & hirsutum,
ubi magni sunt oculi, & nasus resimus, praestat igitur, siquidem de
solo agitur naso, ut ex eo resimo, humiditatem, ex eo adunco siccitatem
coniectes. Nec de totius animantis temperie ex his particulis pronuncies.
Pari modo oculorum, & alterius cuiuslibet partis proprium temperamentum
ex propriis indiciis estimare est satius. Ergo de totius corporis
temperie non recte ab una quapiam particula iudicium sumitur. Cum siue
humoris uincentis, siue caloris, siue etiam amborum, cesios oculos
indicium statuere oportet, utique proprii ipsorum sic, non omnium totius
corporis partium, temperamenti documentum erunt. Neque enim si dura
& macra crura sunt, omnino siccum est totius corporis temperamentum.
Alii nanque affatim carnosi, & pingues, & crassi, & prominenti uentre,
& molles, & candidi etiam cum eiusmodi cruribus cernuntur. Verum si
totius corporis temperies, pari ratione se habeat, sicci omnino sunt,
quibus macra sunt crura. Humidi, quibus crassa, praeterea quibus acutus
est nasus, aut aduncus. Hi sicci, quibus resimus humidi. Ad eundem modum
de oculis, temporibus, caeteris denique omnibus particulis, iudicandum.
Quibus impar temperamentum est, nec omnium particularum idem, alienum a
ratione est, ex unicae particulae natura, de omnibus sententiam ferre.
Porro tale quippiam plurimis eorum imposuit, cum non de hominum modo,
sed etiam aliorum animalium totius corporis temperamento, ex indiciis,
quae in cute tantum spectantur, iudicium ferre sunt ausi. Neque enim
si dura cutis est, necessario siccum est animans. Sed fieri potest, ut
tantum cutis sic sit affecta. Sed nec si nigra haec hirta ue est. Simili
modo, nec si mollis haec, depilis ue est, humidum ex necessitate totum
est animal. Verum si per totum aequabiliter est attemperatum, ratio
est, ut qualis sit cutis, talis sit & reliquarum partium unaquaeque.
Sin inequaliter, non item. Quippe ostrearum totum corpus humidissimum
est, cutis ipsa siccissima. Est enim iis qua teguntur testa, cuiusmodi
est nobis cutis. Atque hinc illis Graece nomen ὀστρακόδερμα enim
nominantur omnia eiusmodi animantia, propterea quod cutis iis ostraco
.i. testae est adsimilis. Iam malacostraca, id est quae molli testa
integuntur, ueluti marinae locustae & camari, & cancri, cutem quidem
habent siccam, reliquam uniuersam temperiem humidam. Immo uero illud
ipsum humiditatis in carne nonnunquam animalibus causa est, quod siccam,
terrenamque portionem natura his uniuersam circa cutem reponit. Non est
igitur putandum, nec quod cutis ostreis sicca est, illico carnem quoque
esse siccam. Nec quod haec praehumida, muccosaque est, iam cutem quoque
eiusmodi esse. Quippe equum est quanque particulam ex seipsa dignosci.
Ergo tum in his peccant, ii qui commentarios de temperamentis nobis
reliquerunt, tum quod id omittunt, quod Hyppocrates rectissime admonuit,
spectandum esse ex quibus, in quae mutationes sunt factae. Fit enim
non raro, ut praesens nota prioris temperamenti sit, non eius quod in
corpore nunc habeat, ueluti si quis annos natus sexaginta denso pilo
sit, non quod calidus & siccus nunc sit, sed quod ante talis fuerit,
consistant autem ei prius geniti pili. Ad eum modum, quo herbae, quae
uere sunt enatae, nonnunquam perseuerant aestate. Aliis enim spacio &
paulatim, contigit a plurima illa hirtitate mutari. Labentibus scilicet
pre nimia siccitate pilis, aliis diutissime pili permanent utique qui nec
in processu temporis admodum siccantur, et a primo ualentem habuerunt
originem. Arborum ritu, quarum radices in terra ualenter comprehenderunt.
Caue igitur si quemadmodum pilosum uideas, hunc statim melancholicum
putes. Sed si quidem floret adhuc aetas, nondum esse talem. Sin iam
declinat, melancholicum existima. At si senex est, non item. Fiunt
nanque melancholica temperamenta, ex sanguinis adustione: Caeterum cum
id pati incipit, non statim est percoctus, uerum hirtus abunde, qui
calidus & siccus est, celeriter erit. Si modo eorum, quae proposita sunt,
meminimus. Non illico melancholicus. Quippe cutis densitas, crassiorum
excrementorum transitum remorans in temperamentis, quae calida in summo
sunt, comburi ea cogit. Ita fit, ut tale iis nunc sit excrementum,
quod pilos creat, quale olim procedente tempore in uasis sanguinis est
futurum. Tum haec igitur omissa prioribus sunt. Tum praeter haec quod ex
natura excrementorum, indefinite de temperamentis pronunciant. Putant
enim particularum temperiem, similem esse cum excrementorum natura. Id
uero usquequaque uerum non est. Sed fieri interim potest, ut pituitosa
excrementa colligantur, nec tamen humida sit particula, immo frigida
omnino: humida uero non omnino. Quippe cum siccam quoque esse liceat.
Quod autem eis imposuit, facile animaduertitur. Non enim norunt quod
ex cibis, nequaquam ex ipso corpore nostro, pituita fit. Quare nihil
miri est, si ubi ingestos cibos (qui humidi fortasse natura sint) non
uincit, simile iis, ipsum quoque excrementum creet. Non est igitur quod
opinentur, tanquam corpus siccum est, itidem excrementum quoque esse
siccum. Etenim si quis ab initio sicciore, frigidioreque temperamento
statim fuit, is non melancholicus est, sed utique ab excrementis
pituitosus. Quod si ex habitus mutatione, frigidus, siccusque est
redditus, necessario hic talis iam etiam melancholicus est uerbi gratia:
Si quis ante calidus & siccus, ex sanguine urendo plurimam generauit
atram bilem. Est enim is praeterquam quod siccus est & frigidus, protinus
etiam melancholicus. Sin a principio frigidus & siccus fuit. Habitus
quidem corporis eius albus, mollis, depilis, uenis, articulisque parum
expressis, gracilis, & tangenti frigidus, animus uero minime audax, &
timens, & tristis, non tamen excrementa huic melancholica sunt. In his
igitur omnibus peccant plerique medicorum ex eo quod proprias notas
respuunt, atque ad ea quae non perpetuo, sed frequenter accidunt,
conuertuntur. Eiusdem erroris occasione, & quod excalfacit, id etiam
siccare omnino putant. Hoc enim ueluti coronide summaque uniuersi
sermonis addito, secundum iam librum finire statui. Quippe phlegmone
obsessas partes calida perfundentes aqua, atque ita uacuari ab iis
humorem cernentes, clare indicatum arbitrantur, siccitatem omnino calori
succedere. Neque id modo ubi cum siccitate is, uerum etiam ubi cum humore
est coniunctus. Caeterum non est idem uel uacuasse ab aliquo humorem,
qui locis quibusdam sit dispersus, uel propriam particulae alicuius
temperiem sicciorem reddidisse. Siquidem inequalis quaedam in his, quae
phlegmone laborant partibus, intemperies est, similaribus scilicet
corporibus a proprio temperamento nondum amotis, sed assidue adhuc in
mutatione atque alteratione uersatis, omnibus nimirum interpositis inter
eas spaciolis, fluxione refertis. Quaecunque igitur calida humidaque
natura sunt, cum sic affectis admouentur, ipsa quidem superuacanea quae
media similarium spacia occuparunt, euocant. Corpora tamen ipsa tantum
abest, ut siccent, ut etiam illis humorem adiiciant. Ac ipsa quidem
ueritas ita se habet. Demonstratio tamen euidens dictis requiritur.
Verum eam cum & longiorem existimem, quam ut huic libro inseratur, &
auditorem desyderet, qui medicamentorum facultatis sit non ignarus, in
praesens differo. Caeterum ubi in tertio libro de omni temperamentorum
genere tractauero, ac de iis, quae potestate calida, frigida, humida,
siccaque sunt omnem methodum indicauero, mox integrum libellum scribere
de inequali intemperie decreui. Quippe si absoluetur a nobis uniuersa de
temperamentis disceptatio, tum ad libros de medicamentis, tum ad medendi
methodum non parum adferet commodi.

Ac quod energia, siue actu calidorum, frigidorum, humidorum, & siccorum
unumquodque tale esse dicatur, uel quod summam habet eiusmodi qualitatem,
uel quod uincit in eo id genus qualitatum aliqua, uel quod ad cognati
generis mediocre aliquid, uel ad unum quodlibet nobis sit collatum, prius
est traditum. Monstratum praeterea est quemadmodum ea quis agnoscere
exacte possit. Reliquum est, ut de iis, quae talia potestate sunt
disseramus, si tamen prius explicuerimus, quid ipso potestatis nomine
significetur. Est autem breuis eius & facillima, & clara explicatio.
Quippe quod quale dicitur, tale nondum est, sed potest tale esse, id
hoc esse potestate dicimus. Hominem uerbi gratia, qui modo natus fuit,
rationalem, & auem uolatilem, & canem uenaticum, & equum celerem.
Scilicet quod eorum unum quodque futurum omnino est, si nihil id
extrinsecus impediat, hoc ceu iam id sit, appellantes. Vnde arbitror haec
esse potestate, non actu dicimus, perfectum nanque est, ac iam praesens,
ipsa energia, siue quod actu est. Quod uero potestate est, imperfectum, &
adhuc futurum, atque ut fiat quidem id quod dicitur, ueluti habile, non
tamen adhuc subsistens. Siquidem nec infans rationalis iam est, sed talis
futuros. Nec qui modo aeditus est canis, uenator, qui scilicet adhuc
non uideat, sed quod uenari queat si ad iustum perueniat incrementum,
sic nominatur. Ac maxime quidem proprie sola ea potestate esse dicimus,
in quibus natura ipsa suopte impetu ad absolutionem uenit. Vtique si
nihil ei extrinsecus impedimento sit. Praeterea quaecunque fientium
(ut sic dicam) continentes materiae sunt. Nec refert continentes, an
conuenientes, an proprias dicas. Quippe cum ex omnibus indicetur, quod
propinquum est, quodque nec alia intercedente mutatione sic dicitur,
uerbi, gratia cum sanguinem potestate carnem appellas, quoniam minimam
mutationem ad carnis generationem requirat. At non qui in uentriculo
habetur concoctus cibus, continens carnis materia est. Sed prius sit
sanguis oportet, longius etiam absunt, maza & panis. Quippe quae ut caro
fiant, certas sui mutationes requirant. Caeterum haec quoque omnia,
potestate caro dicuntur. Etiam ante haec ignis, aer, aqua, & terra.
Etiam horum ipsorum communis materia. Atque haec quidem omnia magis,
minusue abusiue loquentibus nobis dicuntur. Primus autem modus eorum,
quae potestate esse aliquid dicuntur, maxime est proprius. Proximus huic
est eorum, quae sunt propinqua materia, ueluti si fumidam exhalationem
flammam esse, aut halitum aerem dixeris. Dicitur potestate esse, & quod
ei quod ex accidenti dicitur, est ex aduerso positum, ut si carnosi quis
iuuenis in frigida lauationem, corpus eius ex accidenti, non ex propria
potestate calefacere dicat. Ergo tot modis etiam potestate calida,
frigida, humida, & sicca dicentur. Dubitabitur quoque non absurde, cur
Castoreum, uel Euphorbium, uel Pyrethrum, uel Struthion, uel Nitrum, uel
Misy, calida esse dicamus. Rursus lactucam, uel cicutam, uel mandragoram,
uel salamandram, uel papauer, frigida. Vtrum ne sub praedictis iam modis
comprehendantur, an alia quapiam ratione dicantur, quae dicta nondum
sit. Bitumen nanque resina, & saeuum & oleum, & pix, calida potestate
sunt, quod utique energia calida celerrime fiant. Etenim celerrime
inflammantur. Praeterea cum corporibus nostris admouentur, ea manifeste
calefaciunt. At Calcitis, Misy, Synapi, Nitrum, Acoron, Meon, Costus, &
Pyrethrum cum nobis sunt admota, calida uidentur. Alia magis, alia minus.
Non tamen sunt idonea, quae in flammam uertantur. An igitur seipsos
fallunt, qui id solum estimant. Nunquid aliqua non facile in flammam
transmutentur, quos utique non sic. Sed an non uertantur in prunam
estimare oportebat. Cum sit pruna ignis non minus, quam flamma. Hoc
tamen discrimine, quod aere, uel aereo quopiam in ignem mutato flamma,
terra, uel terrea re aliqua accensa, fit pruna. Atque hactenus quidem
consentire secum sermo omnino uidetur. Siquidem uidentur medicamenta ea,
quae ubi ignem attigerint facile accenduntur, nos quoque excalfacere,
nisi si quod propter crassitiem intra corpus non facile assumitur.
Disseretur enim de iis latius in libris de medicamentorum uiribus.
Quaecunque tamen medicamenta nostrum corpus excalfacere uidentur, ea
prompte uertuntur in ignem. At quomodo igitur inquiunt tangentibus non
sentiuntur calida, hoc haud scio cur dicant. Nam si energia, iamque
calidum, esse praedictorum quidque diceremus profecto mirari liceret,
quomodo tangentibus non appareant calida. Nunc quod possint facile calida
esse, idcirco ea potestate talia uocamus. Itaque nihil miri, si eos,
qui se tangunt nondum calefaciant. Veluti enim nec ignis ipse augetur,
priusquam uicta ab eo ligna sint mutata, quod aliquo temporis spatio
omnino fit. Ita nec animantium calor a medicamentis, nisi illa prius ab
ipso sint mutata. Quippe alio genere calefit is qui ab igne uel sole
intempescit. Alio is qui a praedictorum quouis medicamentorum. Illa
nanque actu sunt calida, medicamenta nequaquam. Itaque nec calefacere nos
ualent priusquam actu talia fiant. At quod actu talia sint, id a nobis
accipiunt, ueluti sicci calami ab igne. Ita uero & ligna ex sua quidem
natura frigida sunt uniuersa. Sed quae sicciora sunt, & gracilia, ea
facile mutantur in ignem. Quae humidiora sunt & crassa, spacio egent
maiore. Nihil igitur miri est, si medicamenta quoque primum quidem in
parua & tenuia frangi postulant, secundo loco, ut tempore aliquo tametsi
minimo, corpori nostro quo calida fiant sint adiuncta. Tu uero si ea
nec comminuta, nec prius calefacta, calida tamen iam fieri censes,
quid significet, quod potestate calidum dicimus, parum mihi meminisse
uideris. Sic enim ea exploras, tanquam energia sint calida. Sed nec illud
mirum, si quo recalfaciant, calefieri ipsa prius postulent. Cum idem
fieri cernatur, & in lignorum exemplo. Quippe haec uanescentem alias,
morientemque flammam tum seruant, tum uero augent dum ab hac, ipsa prius
calefiunt. Non est igitur alienum, calorem, qui in animantibus habetur,
eiusmodi medicamentis quasi alimento quodam uti quemadmodum ignis ligno.
Quippe id ita quoque fieri cernimus. Si uero perfrigerato corpori
eorum quoduis quantumuis diligenter comminutum inspergas, prorsus non
calefit. Proinde quae refrigeratae partes sunt, eas eiusmodi medicamentis
plurimum perfricamus, una calorem perfricando excitantes, una rarum,
quod prius frigore fuit densum, reddentes. Quo scilicet tum introrsus
pharmacum penetret, tum naturali animantis calori coniunctum mutetur, ac
calefiat. Quippe cuius si particula quaepiam uel minima, calorem energia
concipiat, hunc deinde in totum propter continuitatem porrigat, perinde
ac si ex parua scintilla tedam summo tenus accendas. Siquidem hanc
uniuersam facile depascitur ignis, nihilo amplius scintillam requirens.
Ac quidquid quidem potestate calidum est, huic nondum in natura sua
calidum frigido praepollet, sed in propinquo est, ut praepolleat, adeo
ut breuem opem quo uincat extrinsecus requirat. Hanc illi modo frictio
abunde praestare potest, modo uel ignis, uel corporis alicuius natura
calidi contactus. Non est igitur tam arduum rationem reddere, quid
causae sit, cur alia protinus ut corpus nostrum contigere, recalfacere
id possint. Alia post longius id efficere spacium. Quippe ex iis, quae
igni appropinquant. Alia statim accenduntur, ueluti elychnium, & tenuis
teda, & pix, & siccus calamus. Alia nisi diutius sunt admota, non
uincuntur, sicut uiride lignum. Illud potius definiamus, cuius utique
demonstratio cum de naturalibus potentiis agemus, tradetur. Ex hypothesi
nunc quoque propositorum causa, eo utemur, quatuor nimirum dicentes
totius corporis proprias facultates esse. Vnam idoneorum tractricem,
alteram eorum omnium retentricem, tertiam alteratricem, & quartam quae
alieni sit segregatrix, easdemque facultates effectus esse totius in
quouis corpore substantiae. Quam etiam constare ex calido, frigido,
humido, & sicco inter se mixtis dicimus. Vbi igitur corpus una qualibet
earum, quas in se habet qualitatum, id quod sibi admouetur, demutat,
nec ipsum hoc casu tota sua substantia existimandum est agere, nec quod
ab ipso mutatur posse ei assimilari. Quare nec unquam nutriet, quod ita
mutatum est, id quod se mutauit. At si illud mutet, id est tota sua
substantia operetur, utique tum sibi assimilabit id quod mutatur, tum ab
eo nutrietur. Neque enim aliud nutritio est, quam adsimilatio perfecta.
Quoniam autem hoc definitum est, inde rursus incipiendum. Omne animal
conueniente sibi nutritur alimento: conueniens autem cuique alimentum
est quicquid assimilari corpori quod nutritur, potest. Oportet igitur
toti nutrientis substantiae, cum tota nutriti natura communio aliqua,
similitudoque sit: prorsus hic quoque non paruo excessus, defectusque
subsistente in ipsis discrimine, cum alia magis consentientia, similiaque
sint, alia minus. Proinde etiam alia conficiendi opere ualentiore, ac
diuturniore, alia minore, ac breuiore egent: auium caro minore, suilla
maiore, bubula etiam hac maiore. Vinum uero ut assimiletur opus desyderat
minimum. Quo fit, ut tum nutriat, tum roboret celerrime. Porro id quoque
in concoquendi instrumentis, uentriculo, iocinore, & uenis, prorsus
aliquamdiu traxerit oportet. Quibus scilicet praeparatum, nutrire
corpus iam queat. Ante uero quam in his sit demutatum fieri non potest,
ut animalis corpori sit nutrimentum. Ne si per totum diem, ac noctem
extrinsecus super corpus sit impositum. Multoque minus panis, uel beta,
uel maza, foris imposita nutriat. At quae quidem adsimilantur, omnia
nutrimenta uocantur. Reliqua omnia medicamenta, est porro & horum natura
duplex. Quippe uel cuiusmodi sunt adsumpta, eiusmodi etiam permanentia,
uincunt, corpusque mutant, ad eum modum, quo id cibos, atque haec
prorsus tum uenenosa, tum natura animalis corruptricia medicamenta
sunt, uel mutationis initium ab animalis corpore consecuta, deinceps
iam putrescunt, ac corrumpuntur, deinde corpus quoque una corrumpunt ac
putrefaciunt. Sunt autem haec quoque noxia uenena. Est his etiam amplius
tertia medicamentorum species, eorum nimirum, quae corpus recalfaciunt
quidem, mali tamen nihil adferunt. Est & quarta eorum species, quae &
agunt & patiuntur aliquid: sed spatio uincuntur, planeque adsimilantur.
Accidit porro his, ut tam medicamenta sint, quam nutrimenta. Nihil autem
miri est, si exiguum consecuta momentum, aliqua maximam a priore natura
mutationem habent. Cernuntur enim eiusmodi multa in his, quae extra nos
sunt. Siquidem in ea Mysia, quae est Asiae pars, domus hac aliquando
ratione conflagrauit. Erat proiectum columbinum stercus, cui iam putri &
excalfacto, ac uaporem edenti, & tangentibus admodum calido in propinquo
fenestra fuerat, ita ut iam contingeret eius ligna, quae large nuper
illita resina fuerant. Media igitur aestate, cum sol plurimus incidisset,
accendit tum resinam, tum ligna. Hinc autem & fores quaedam aliae, quae
prope fuerant, & fenestrae nuper etiam resina illite, facile ignem
conceperant, atque ad tectum usque summiserant. Vbi autem excepta semel
a tecto est flamma, celeriter in totam domum est grassata. Hoc arbitror
modo aiunt & Archimedem hostium triremes urentibus speculis incendisse.
Porro succenditur his prompte, lana, stupa, elychnium, ferula. Quicquid
denique similiter his siccum, rarumque est. Flammam edunt, & lapides
attriti, atque hoc magis, si quis sulphure illos illeuerit. Eiusmodi
erat medicamentum Medeae. Quippe quod quibus est illitum, omnia ubi in
id incidit, calor accendit. Constat id ex sulphure, & humido bitumine.
Iam illud ceu rem mirandam quidam ostentauit. Extinxit lucernam, ac
rursus muro admouens, accendit. Alter lapidi eam admouit. Fuerant autem
tum murus, tum lapis sulphure contacti. Quod ubi deprehensum est,
desiit mirum uideri, quod ostentabatur. Ergo omnia id genus medicamina,
perfecte, atque ad consummationem calida adhuc non sunt, aptissima tamen
ut calida fiant. Atque idcirco potestate calida dicuntur. Ac de iis
quidem nulla est dubitatio. Sed nec cur uinum bibitum ualenter corpus
calefaciat. Monstratum enim supra paulo est, id non utique ut calidum
medicamentum. Immo ut conueniens nutrimentum calefacere animal. Tanquam
enim ignis idoneum alimentum, ignem ipsum auget, ita quicquid corporum
natura calidorum proprium & naturale est nutrimentum, id ea semper non
solum roborabit, sed etiam insitum eorum calorem augebit. Atque id quidem
omnis nutrimenti communis effectus est. Vino praeter caetera proprium, ac
suum est mutationis celeritas. Ita utique, ut tedae, elychnii, stuppae,
picis. Iam uero ab ignis exemplo non digressi: admoneamus rursum de
lignis uiridibus, quae ipsa quoque ignis nutrimentum sunt. Caeterum
non statim, aut continuo, eoque saepenumero igni iniecta, non solum
flammam quasi sopiunt, sed etiam si imbecilla est & parua, corrumpendae
quoque eius periculum afferunt. Sic profecto & in animalibus cibi, qui
uti prorsus adsimilentur, & corpus nutriant spatio egent, hi frigus
uniuersi, potius quam calorem afferre in praesenti uidentur. Caeterum
calefaciunt hi quoque spatio, non secus, ac reliqui cibi, si semel
ut corpus nutriant, sint consecuti. Omne enim nutrimentum, quatenus
nutrimentum est, animalis calorem auget. At si deuoretur quidem ut
nutrimentum, nec tamen superetur, id erit quod Hyppocrates dixit, nomine
quidem nutrimentum, re autem minime. Quippe cum trifariam nutrimentum
dicatur, sicut ipse docuit his uerbis. Nutrimentum est, & quod nutrit, &
quod ueluti nutrimentum est, & quod futurum nutrimentum est, quod utique
iam nutrit, & corpori adiungitur, nec amplius futurum est, id proprie
nutrimentum nominatur. Idem uero & corpus quod nutrit, excalfacit, quod
reliquorum neutrum facit. Quod scilicet proprie nutrimenta non sint. Sed
alterum eorum ueluti nutrimentum, alterum tale futurum. Proinde nec uinum
ipsum semper animal calefacit, aeque, ut nec oleum flammam accendit,
tametsi aptissimum est ignis nutrimentum. Immo si imbecille & exigue
flammae, confertim multum oleum infundas, suffocabis eam, prorsusque
extingues, potiusquam augebis. Sic igitur & uinum, ubi plus bibitur, quam
ut uinci possit, tantum abest, ut animal calefaciat, ut etiam frigidiora
uitia gignat. Quippe apoplexiae, & paraplegiae, & quae Graece caros,
& comata uocamus, & neruorum resolutio, & comitiales conuulsiones, &
tetani, immodicum uini potum comitantur. Quorum unumquodque frigidum est
uitium, generatim enim quaecunque assumpta in corpus, ut nutrimentum
calefaciunt, haec interim frigefacere deprehendas. Eque scilicet,
ut flammam ab eadem materia, non augeri modo, uerum etiam aliquando
extingui. Atque haec quidem omnia, tum iis, quae de elementis, tum iis
quae de temperamentis sunt prodita consentiunt. Illud fortasse dissonare
uidebitur, quod ex iis, quae ut nutrimentum comeduntur, aliqua cuti
imposita, hanc erodunt, atque exulcerant. Sicut sinapi, muria, allia,
cepe. Verum hoc quoque cum positis a principio hypothesibus concordat.
Etenim propterea, quod tum in uentre concocta, tum in uenis in sanguinem
uersa mutantur, alteranturque, praeterea quod uno loco non permanent:
sed in multas partes diuisa, undequaque ferunt, adde & quod non solum
multis succis miscentur, sed etiam cibis, cum quibus sumuntur, adhaec
quod celeriter eorum & concoctio, & partium separatio perficitur, ita
ut quod conueniens in eis est adsimiletur, quod superuacaneum & acre,
per aluum urinas, & sudorem excernatur: propter haec inquam, omnia
quod foris impositum exulcerat, id comestum non exulcerat. Quamuis si
uel unum quodlibet horum accederet, satis esset ad ea quae foris sunt
integra seruanda, uerbi causa mutatio ipsa. Si nanque non maneat sinapi,
quale extrinsecus fuit, cum est adsumptum, manifestum est, nec uim eius
manere censendum. Quod si tum dirimuntur eius partes, tum purgantur,
multo utique magis sic censendum. Iam satis erat quod nec eodem loci
manet. Cum nec circa cutim aliquid efficere posse uideatur, nisi diutius
immoretur. Sed nec mixtio ipsa cum multis cibis parum momenti habet.
Si enim id citra alium cibum solum assumas, facile intelliges quantum
molestiae, & rosionis uentriculo sit allaturum. Quin etiam, si plurimo
dulci admixtum succo, cuti id imponas, quam nihil adferat incommodi.
Cum igitur praedictorum unum quodlibet per se, satis prohibere possit,
quo minus sinapi, quod foris facit, idem facere intus possit, multo
arbitror magis, ubi multa simul coierint. Nam & coquendo alteratur, &
expurgatur, & cum multis aliis miscetur, & uarie distribuitur, & in
omnem partem fertur, nec in ulla moratur. Quod autem si acrimoniam
suam seruaret, interna quoque omnino exulceraret, ex iis, quae sponte
accidunt ulceribus, intelligas. Gignitur enim non raro aliis ex uitioso
cibo, aliis ex quapiam in ipso corpore corruptela, & putredine, uitiosus
succus, quam cacochymian uocant. Iis aliquando interiorum quoque aliquid
exulceratur. Magna tamen ex parte, cutis quoniam in hanc excrementa quae
in habitum corporis colliguntur, natura expellit, multis & assiduis
ulceribus afficitur. Quippe cancri phagedene, herpetes erodentes,
carbunculi, & quae chyronia, & Telephia uocantur, milleque aliae ulcerum
generationes, ab eiusmodi cacochymia nascuntur. Neque igitur talium
quicquam est dubitandum. Sed nec cur medicamentorum nonnulla, cum nihil
nos extrinsecus offendunt, intro assumpta magnum afferant malum. Aliqua
rursus intro assumpta, nonnunquam laedant, nonnunquam conferant. Aliqua
non solum intro assumpta, sed etiam extrinsecus applicita offendant.
Quippe ut semel dicam, nihil foris, intusque parem agendi facultatem
habet. Neque enim aut uipere uenenum, aut rabidi canis spuma, ut aspidis
uirus, quae tamen si extrinsecus corpori occurrant, offendere creduntur,
parem uim habent, uel soli cuti applicita, uel intro assumpta. Sed nec
illud est mirandum, si certorum medicamentorum uis, ad profundum non
peruenit. Neque enim necesse est, ut omnia parem habeant uim. Quod si ex
iis, quae intro sumuntur non pauca, certo tempore, & certa quantitate,
& in mixtura, cum certis accepta, conferunt. Intempestiue autem &
largius, nec cum aliis admixta laedunt, ne id quidem dubitationem ullam
disputationi pariat. Siquidem id tum cibis, tum igni, tum uero omnibus,
ut sic dicam quae corpori occurrunt, accidere solet. Nam & mediocri
nobis flamma nonnunquam opus est, eaque usi, plurimum ex ea iuuamur.
Cum tamen immodica flamma nos urat. Ad eundem modum & frigide potio quae
mediocris est, confert quae immodica est, maximam affert lesionem. Quid
igitur miri est, esse medicamen aliquod, adeo calidum potestate, ut si
multum eius sumatur, ac in uacuum corpus inferatur, erodat prorsus,
uratque. Sin exiguum sit, & cum iis, quae uehementiam eius remittant,
conuinctum, non modo nihil incommodi adferat, uerum etiam calefaciendo
iuuet. Lacrimam enim, uel Cyrenaicam, uel medicam, uel particham ipsam
quidem per se, citra incommodum sumere non est. At si omnino exigua,
uel cum aliis tempore congruente sit sumpta, magnopere conducit. Atque
ad hunc quidem modum, quaecunque corpus excalfaciunt, ubi mutationis
principium in ipso sicut dictum prius est accepere, recalfacere illud
sunt apta. Quae uero refrigerant, ueluti papaueris succus, haec a nostro
corpore, ne uel paulum quidem demutantur, sed ipsum statim uincunt, ac
mutant, etiam si calefacta prius dederis. Est enim eorum natura frigida,
quemadmodum aqua. Quare illud recte Aristoteli, sicut alia multa, dictum
est. Calidorum, frigidorum, siccorum, & humidorum corporum, quaedam esse
talia per se, quaedam ex accidenti. Sicut aqua per se quidem frigida est,
ex accidenti uero aliquando calida: uerum acquisititius eius calor breui
perit, naturalis frigiditas manet. Tanquam igitur calida aqua flammae
iniecta, eam extinguit. Sic meconium si id quantumuis calefactum dederis,
& calorem animalis perfrigerabis, & necis periculum afferes. Omnia
igitur id genus medicamenta, si exigue sint data, & una cum iis, quae
uehementiam frigoris eorum castigare ualeant, nonnunquam usum aliquem
corporibus nostris praestant, quemadmodum in opere de medicamentis
dicetur. Siquidem medicamen id quod Cantharidas recipit, hydericis
prodest. Tametsi cantharis ipsa, uesicam omnino exulcerat. Verum ubi
per ea, quae admiscentur castigata est, ac corpori, quod plurimo humore
grauatur, tum offertur, illum per urinas expellit. Maxime igitur est
attendendum in omnibus, quae potestate calida, frigida ue dicuntur,
sint ne ex natura eorum, quae nutrire corpus possunt, an eiusmodi, quae
exiguum alterationis momentum nacta, deinde secundum propriam naturam
alterata, corpus ipsum aliquo modo afficiunt. Tertio loco an nullo
pacto ab eo, quicquam alterentur. Si nanque ex nutrientium sunt genere,
siquidem uincantur, calefaciunt. Si non uincantur, refrigerant. Sin ex
iis sunt quae exiguum quippiam alterantur, omnino calefaciunt. Si uero
ex iis, quae omnino non alterantur, maxime refrigerant. Attendere autem,
ut dictum est quam maxime oportet, ac discernere, quae per se sunt, ab
iis, quae per accidens, non in calidis & frigidis modo, sed nihilo etiam
setius in siccis & humidis. Quippe aliqua talium, cum siccam substantiam
sint sortita, ubi largo calore sunt liquata, humiditatis phantasiam
praebent, ueluti aes, & ferrum. Quaedam per se humida, ubi in syncero
frigore sunt morata, apparent sicca sicut glacies. Minime igitur de iis
omnibus faciendum absoluto, & sine ulla exceptione iudicium est, sicut
in superioribus monuimus. Sed cum eo, ut quemadmodum sese in calore,
frigoreque habeant, consyderentur. Siquidem si exiguo praedita calore,
nihilominus humida cernuntur, talia esse ex propria natura sunt censenda,
tametsi cum copioso calore sint sicca. Quae uero uel sub feruenti calore
fluunt, uel sub puro rigore sunt concreta, ne horum quidem altera per
se humida, altera per se sicca sunt existimanda. Ergo tum adhunc modum
distinguere conueniet, quae per se sunt, ab iis, quae per accidens,
tum ad haec ipsa spectantibus, eorum quae potestate calida, frigida,
humida, sicca ue sunt, iudicium faciendum. Non enim ad id quod secundum
accidens est, respicientibus: sed ad id, quod secundum se est, id quod
potestate est, iudicari debebit. Porro communis in omnibus, unaque
iudicandi ratio est, alterationis celeritas. At cum calidum, frigidum,
humidum, & siccum dicantur, ὁμονύμως, quod scilicet alia per id, quod
exuperat, alia quod eam qualitatem a qua sunt denominata, summam habeant,
in utrumcunque horum prompte uertitur, de quo agitur iudicium, tale
potestate fuerit. Oleum nanque calidum potestate est, nimirum quod flamma
facile fiat. Eodem modo resina, bitumen, & pix. Vinum autem, quod facile
fiat sanguis. Pari modo mel, & caro, & lac. Atque haec quidem totis
ipsorum alteratis substantiis, nutrimenta se alterantium sunt. Quae uero
una qualibet qualitate, alterantur ac mutantur, ea medicamenta tantum
sunt. Medicamenta itidem sunt, & quae nulla substantiae suae mutata
parte, sed tota seruata integra, corpus ipsum afficiunt. Caeterum grauia
& naturae animalis corrumpentia. Vnde & totum eorum genus deleterion
& pestilens dici reor. Quippe haec non eo minus genere deleteria sunt
dicenda, quod ubi plane minima exhibentur, nullam inferunt sensibilem
noxam. Sic nanque neque ignis ipse calidus sit, neque nix frigida. Nam
horum quoque si quid prorsus exiguum est, nullum euidens in corporibus
nostris excitat affectum. Quippe centesima unius scintillae pars, est
quidem omnino genere ignis. Caeterum adeo nos non urat excalfaciatue,
ut corpori incidens, ne sensum quidem ullum sui excitet. Ad eundem
modum frigidae asperginis centesima portio non modo nihil offendat, aut
refrigeret, sed nec sensum sui ullum praebeat. Nequaquam igitur sic
iudicanda deleteria sunt. Immo totius naturae suae contrarietate. Porro
iudicabitur contrarietas, ex ea quae media intercedit mutatione. In
elementis uerbi gratia, neque aqua mutari potest in ignem, neque ignis
in aquam: sed ambo in aerem, is uero in utraque. At illa in alterutrum
nullo modo. Ergo continens, & sine medio est aquae mutatio in aerem,
itemque ignis. Non continens, ignis & aquae in alterutrum: haec igitur
inter se contraria pugnantiaque sunt. Non dissimili ratione papaueris
succus, hominis corpori prorsus est contrarius ut quod in eum quicquam
agere ne una quidem qualitate possit, multo minus tota sua substantia
possit. Atque unum quidem deleteriorum genus eiusmodi est, alterum est
eorum, quae ex nostro calore momentum aliquod mutationis accipiunt, ac
deinde in multifarias alterationes uertuntur, quibus corrumpi naturam
nostram accidit. Eiusmodi enim omnia deleteria genere sunt, etiam si
propter exiguitatem nonnunquam nihil quod sentiatur efficiant. Ac quae
corporis naturam rodunt putrefaciunt, & liquant, merito potestate calida
nominantur. Contra quae refrigerant, & sensum auferunt, torporemque
notabilem afferunt, frigida. Et priora quidem nihil non rationi consonum,
nec ipsa pati, nec in corporibus nostris efficere uidentur. Siquidem
calido corpori applicita, & mutationis momentum aliquod hinc adepta,
partim eorum ad summam caliditatem, partim proueniunt ad putredinem.
Iure igitur pro affectu quem ipsa consecuta sunt, etiam corpus animalis
afficiunt. At quae corpus tametsi ipsa calida sunt, applicata, tamen
refrigerant, non paruam dubitationem afferunt, utrius potius naturae
sint. Nam si energia semel calida sunt reddita, cur animal non
calefaciunt? Sin nondum sunt calefacta, quomodo apparent calida. Soluetur
dubitatio si distinguatur, quod per se frigidum est, ab eo quod est ex
accidenti. Ita uti Aristoteles docuit. Perit nanque celeriter eorum,
quae ex accidenti sunt calida, acquisititius affectus. Ita ut in priorem
naturae suae statum facile reuertantur. Porro in applicandis iis nobis,
quae natura quidem sunt frigida, sed per accidens calida, duo haec
contingere est necesse, ut & acquisititius eorum calor pereat, & propria
eorum temperies, a nostra nihil immutata, frigida perstet. Et quid miri si
papaueris succus, mandragora, uel cicuta, uel similium aliquid, quamuis
exhibeantur calefacta, paulo post euadunt frigida? Cum idem patiantur,
ptisana, & lac, & far, & panis. Vbi in imbecillum uentrem demissa, ab
eo non superantur. Euomuntur enim non raro abunde frigida. Et quod iis
maius est, quodque Hyppocrates notauit, pituita ipsa quamuis iam succus
sit, atque ex cibis in uentre iam concoctis nata, nihilominus frigida
tangentibus sentitur, neque id modo dum in uentre consistit, sed postquam
a uenis ipsis, purgantis, cuiuspiam medicamenti ui, est detracta. Tametsi
enim quam tenacissima est, ac per uim ducitur, attamen ne ipsa quidem
tractus uiolentia calefieri potest. Quid igitur miri, si etiam papaueris
succus, quod naturae nostrae tam contrarium medicamentum est, quam
celerrime refrigeretur, etiam si calefactus sit exhibitus? refrigeret
autem una secum & corpus? Quippe acquisititium calorem non seruat,
propterea quod natura frigidus est. At quia eius substantia a nobis non
alteratur. Immo potius nos alterat, & mutat, idcirco nec a nobis quicquam
recipit caloris, & pro sua natura nos afficit. Itaque cum frigidus
natura sit, & nos utique refrigerat. Nihil igitur in dictione nostra
est dubitationis reliquum. Enimuero quod horum omnium, quae frigida
per naturam sunt, quicquid plus iusto calefeceris, ex propria id natura
recedat, praeterquam quod nullam dubitationem habet etiam praedictis
a nobis, affert testimonium. Sicut enim salamandra ad certum usque
terminum ab igni nihil patitur, uritur autem, si longiore spatio igni
sit admota. Sic & mandragora, & cicuta, & psillium, breui spatio igni
admota, proprium adhuc temperamentum seruant, largius autem excalefacta,
illico corrumpuntur, nec quicquam efficere, quae prius poterant, ualent.
Ac talium quidem omnium natura, hominibus maxime est contraria. Sane
naturam cum dico, uniuersam substantiam, ac temperiem, quae ex primis
elementis conflat, significo, calido, frigido, humido, sicco. Eorum uero,
quae celerrime nutriunt conuenientissima. Reliqua omnia media inter haec
sunt, quorum alia magis, alia minus agere, ac pati a corpore nostro
possunt. Siquidem castoreum, & piper agere magis in corpus nostrum quam
pati ab eo ualent. Vinum, & mel, & ptisana, pati magis, quam agere. Ergo
haec omnia tum agunt circa corpus aliquid, tum uero patiunt. Omnino
enim ubi duo corpora inter se commissa, aliquam multo tempore pugnant,
certantque de alterando, utrunque eorum tum agere, tum pati est necesse.
Fortasse autem & si non multo tempore id fiat, attamen agit etiam id quod
uincitur, in id quod uincit: uerum ita exiguum, ut sensum effugiat. Neque
enim si acutissimo ferro mollissimam caeram toto die ac nocte incidas,
fieri potest, ut non fiat, manifeste obtusius. Ita nimirum illud comode
dici uidetur. Assiduo illisu durum cauat undula saxum. Quippe ita quoque
factum cernitur. Caeterum uno, aut altero ictu nihil adhuc euidens uidere
in talibus licet. Ex quo factum arbitror, ut quaedam ab admotis sibi,
nihil prorsus pati, opinati nonnulli sint. Et cedendum quidem est ita
loquentibus. Saepe uero nobis quoque ipsis ita plerunque loquendum est,
nisi sicubi ad ultimum examen, disputationem perducimus, quemadmodum in
praesentia facimus. Sic igitur ἀειπάθεια, id est, nunquam deficientis
affectionis dogma, iis utique qui ratione solum id estimant, ualente
demonstratione non caret. Non est tamen eius ad priuatas singulatim
obeundas actiones ullus usus. Si nanque adeo exigui affectus sint, quibus
assidue afficimur, ut nulli actioni sensibile, & manifestum incommodum
afferant, facile profecto contemnendi sunt, atque ei qui affectus id
genus nullos esse dicit non repugnandum. Perinde igitur habet, & in
iis, quae nutriunt, prope dixerim omnibus. Quippe quae ipsa quoque in
corpore hominis aliquid faciunt. Sed nec sensibile aliquid prorsus, nec
euidens, diuturna tamen eorum exhibitio, magnopere alterat, mutatque iam
corpora. Sunt enim & quae primo statim usu, manifestam alterationem suam
indicent, ueluti lactuca, quae eos, quibus uenter aestuat, manifeste
refrigerat. Atque a siti uindicat quibus refrigeratum est, manifeste
laedit. Conducit uero & ad somnum non parum, neque id alia ratione ulla
quam quod frigido temperamento & humido est. Verum sic est humida, &
frigida ad hominem, & alia quae nutriri sunt apta, sicut uiridia ligna
ad ignem. Quare rationabiliter cibi, id genus utrumque praestant, & quod
ueluti medicamenta corpus nostrum afficiunt, & quod nutriunt. Toto quidem
concoquendi sui tempore, ut medicamenta. Vbi iam nutriunt ac prorsus sunt
adsimilata, ut quae nihil in nos agant, sed naturalem calorem augeant,
ceu prius est dictum. Quippe id omnium quae nutriant commune est. Nec est
quod miremur, si modo exempli uiridium lignorum non sumus immemores, esse
aliqua, quae priusquam adsimilentur, & nutriant, dum adhuc concoquuntur,
refrigerent, cum adsimilata sunt, ac iam nutriunt, calefaciant. Itaque
usus quoque talium omnium duplex medicis suppetit, tum ut ciborum,
tum ut medicamentorum. Fac nanque mutata sit alicui optima uentriculi
temperies, ad calidiorem. Is profecto quamdiu lactucam concoquit,
refrigerabitur & mediocritatem temperamenti assequetur. Vbi uero ex ea
iam nutritus est, insiti caloris substantiam augebit. In eo igitur uel
maxime sese fallere uidetur. Iuniorum medicorum uulgus, quod ignorat in
nobis aliquando quantitatem caloris intendi, aliquando substantiam eius
augeri. Tum quod utroque genere ueteres calidius factum animal dicant.
Quando etiam calidius fit, siue calorem eius intendas, siue substantiam,
in qua prima consistit, inaugeas, finge nanque ex iis, quae in animalis
corpore continentur, sanguinem esse per se calidum, aut si magis placet
flauam bilem, reliqua omnia ex accidenti esse calida. Vtique quod huius
aliquam habeant partem, nunquid necesse erit animal bifariam calidius
esse, uel quod plus calidorum succorum sit sortitum, uel quod calidiores
eos habeat quam ante. Mihi plane ita uidetur. Ad eundem modum arbitror,
& frigidius erit bifariam, uel quod plures illi succreuerint frigidi
succi, ceu pituita, & nigra bilis, uel quod eorum omnium modo non mutato
sola qualitas sit intenta. An igitur miri quicquam est, si corpus quoad
concoquit, qui frigidus natura cibus est, sicut portulaca, & lactuca,
frigidae qualitatis non parum percipiat, percocto autem, ac iam in bonum
sanguinem uerso: calidi succi accessione, calidius quam prius euadat.
Atqui si nihil horum, aut eiusmodi est, quod fieri nequeat aut etiam
adhuc mirum, desinant iam obstrepere, qui unum eundemque cibum, tum
nutrimenti, tum medicamenti usum corpori praestare negant. Tanquam enim
si omnino non percoqueretur, perpetuo maneret medicamentum, sic cum iam
est percoctum, ambo efficitur. Pone enim prorsus non concoquatur lactuca,
uel si mauis succus ipsius, quando is si liberalius sumatur, similem in
homine cum papaueris succo effectum habet. Nunquid hoc casu medicamentum
tantum erit, nec aliud quicquam? Nemo arbitror de ea re dubitet. Ergo
habet omnino lactuca & medicamenti facultatem. At uero habebat et
nutrimenti: quippe que persepe nutriit. Ambas igitur facultates simul in
se continet, non tamen similiter ambas ostendit. Verum ubi plus egit in
homine, quam sit passa, medicamenti potius indicat facultatem, ubi passa
plus est quam egit, nutrimenti. Nec mirum ullum est, si lactucae tum
agere, tum pati contingit, quando ensi quoque, ceu paulo ante diximus,
non solum in ceram agere, sed etiam ab ea pati accidit. Caeterum eo
quod multo amplius est quod agit, quam quod patitur, alterum latet.
At si durissimum illi ferrum admoueas, contra magis pati, quam agere
tibi uidebitur. Tametsi agit aliquid tum quoque. Sed negligitur prae
exiguitate eius uis. Itaque de omnibus prorsus cibis, illud pronunciare
non dubitamus, quod non solum a nostris corporibus pati, sed etiam agere
aliquid in ea possunt. Iam uero & de quibusdam, quae plane scilicet
& luculenter uidemus agere, quod non tantum cibi sint, sed etiam
medicamenta. Et lactuca quidem tam cibus, quam medicamentum frigidum est.
Eruca tam cibus, quam medicamentum calidum. Quod si castoreum quoque
spatio concoquitur, erit id quoque simul nutrimentum, simul medicamentum
calidum. Ad eundem modum sinapi & piper. Ex herbis quoque anethum, &
ruta, & origanum, & pulegium, & calamynthe, & thymbra, & thymum. Quippe
haec omnia, tum cibi, tum medicamenta calida sunt, prius enim quam in
sanguinem sunt mutata, dum scilicet adhuc concoquuntur, medicamenta.
Mutata uero in sanguinem, non utique iam medicamenta, sed nutrimenta.
Secunda nimirum nutrimenti significatione, qua id significatur, quod
nondum est alimentum, sed ueluti alimentum. Ergo sicut de lactuca paulo
supra fecimus, cum duos uentres, alterum iusto frigidiorem, alterum
iusto calidiorem finximus. Ita nunc quoque pro contemplandis iis, quae
potestate calida sunt, proponamus eosdem uentres. Ergo eum qui frigidior
iusto est, quoad in eo continentur, ac concoquuntur omnes id genus herbae
calefaciunt, atque ad temperamenti aequalitatem reuocant, prosuntque ut
medicamenta. Alterum uero qui calidus est, inflammabunt, ac magnopere
laedent. Atque has quidem alterationes qualitate sua inducent. Nam omnino
percocta, & mutata, ac in sanguinem bonum iam uersa, naturalis in animali
caloris substantiam augebunt, non qualitatem intendent. In totum enim
siue frigidus, siue calidus potestate cibus sit, posteaquam in sanguinem
conuersus est, naturalem calorem similiter augebit. Quoad autem ad
sanguinis formam tendit, nec dum plane sanguis est redditus, refrigerat,
excalfacit ue animal medicamenti ritu. Sane omnis haec disceptatio
ab uno principio pendet. Quo magis seruandum id, memoriaque tenendum
perpetuo est. Cuilibet corpori proprietatem quandam temperamenti esse,
quae huic quidem naturae sit consentiens, ab hac uero sit dissentiens.
Tum si quod conueniens sibi est, in suam naturam transmutet, eo pacto
caloris sui substantiam augere. Sin ipsum sit mutatum, duorum alterum
illi contingere, uel ut calorem quendam conquirat, utique si id a quo
mutatur, calefacit, uel proprium calorem amittat, si id non calefacit.
Liquet igitur ex iis, quod eiusmodi omnia, ex eorum sunt numero, quae
relata ad aliquid dicantur? Cum ad proprietatem mutantis naturae,
quicquid assumitur, uel nutrimenti, uel medicamenti, uel utriusque
rationem sortiatur, uerbi gratia. Cicuta, sturno nutrimentum est, homini
medicamentum. Rursus coturnici, ueratrum nutrimentum est, hominibus
medicamen. Si quidem coturnicum temperies assimilare sibi ueratrum
potest, quod hominum temperies non potest. Ergo manifestum iam arbitror
factum, quod iudicium eius quod respectu nostri calidum, frigidum,
humidum, & siccum dicitur, non ex iis, quae extrinsecus sunt posita. Sed
ex iis, quibus ipsi afficimur, certum exactumque fieri possit. Atque id
tanquam primum, ac maxime sit spectandum. Deinde si res exigit, etiam
quod ab externis petitur. Nam si euidens ad sentiendum, & clarus sit
adhibiti medicamenti affectus, huic reliquis notis omnibus posthabitis
credendum. Sin confusus, & obscurus, aut etiam mixtus, aut ullam omnino
dubitationem sit exhibens, tum utique ad externa omnia conferentes,
de eo iudicandum. Ac neque horum quidem ad ea, quae longius absunt,
sed quae ab ipsa quaesitae rei substantia sunt desumpta. Verbi gratia.
Si oleum calidum est, non id inde spectabitur, quod glutinosum, aut
pallidum, aut leue est: sed quod facile inflammatur. Id nanque erat
illi calidum potestate esse, quod celeriter in energia calidum mutatur.
Ad eundem modum & in corporibus nostris, non utique id expendendum, an
crassarum partium, aut tenuium, aut humidum, aut leue, aut glutinosum,
aut pallidum: sed an calefaciat admotum. Eque uero nec an dulce sit,
an aluum deiiciat, an sanguinem, si instilletur, faciat in missione
fluxilem. Quippe haec quoque superuacua sunt, cum estimare liceat, an
calefaciat cum admouetur, Ergo si notabiliter id, ualenterque faceret,
quemadmodum piper, utique clarum id proculque dubio esset. Nunc cum
minime ualenter, id praestet, merito in quaestionem uenit. Multo uero
magis de rosaceo, & aceto dubitatur a medicis, atque ambigitur calida ne
haec, an frigida potestate sint. Agendum igitur id est, ut in omnibus,
quae potestate calida, frigida, humida, sicca ue dicuntur, exactas
aliquas, clarasque discretiones inueniamus. Sicut ante de energia sic
dictis fecimus. Porro incipiendum arbitror ab iis, quae euidentissima
sunt. Quando in iis exercitatus, facile consequetur ea, quae minus
sunt euidentia. Ergo statim ut corpori hoc, uel illud medicamentum,
cibus ue admouetur, expers esto omnis acquisititii caloris, & frigoris.
Quam enim in superioribus determinationem iniuimus, cum sicca & humida
corpora dignoscenda proposuimus, eadem nobis nunc quoque in iis, quae
potestate calida frigidaque sunt, non minus erit utilis. Nam siue
potestate frigidum, cum id applicas, manifeste calefacias, siue calidum
refrigeres, corpus primo occursu, qualitatis acquisitae, non eius, quae
propria est rei admotae, sensu afficietur. Vt ergo admotae rei uera,
synceraque natura exploretur, tepidum quoad fieri maxime potest, esto,
nec ullam extrinsecus notabilem alterationem ualentis caloris, frigoris
ue ceperit. Ac prima quidem admoti medicamenti praeparatio talis esto.
Applicetur autem cum eius uim exploras, non cuilibet corporis affectui,
sed simplicissimo, et quoad fieri maxime potest, summo. At si summi
quidem caloris affectioni admotum frigoris sensum excitet, erit profecto
sic frigidum. Pari modo si frigido affectui applicatum, calidum statim
appareat, id quoque erit calidum. Sin uel calide affectioni calidum, uel
frigide frigidum sentiatur, non est quod hoc calidum, illud frigidum
omnino pronuncies. Est enim aliquando summi caloris affectus, quem
mediocriter frigidum medicamen adeo non alterat, ut refrigerando,
densandoque summum extrinsecus corpus, calorem intro concludat, ac
difflari uetet. Indeque affectum magis accendat. Ita uero etsi quod
frigido affectui admouetur, nullum afferat calorem, uidendum est. Num
id cum sit aliquid mediocriter calidum, nihil egit in affectum qui
summi indiguit caloris. Ergo nec sic, admoti medicaminis exploranda uis
est, nec si ex accidenti aliquid efficiat, non per se. Iudicabis autem
quod ex accidenti aliquid facit, tum ex affectu ipso, tum tempore. Ex
affectu, si is simplex est, & unus. At a tempore determinabitur iudicium
ad hunc modum. Quod protinus ut admotum est, calefacere, uel refrigerare
manifeste cernitur, id utique & ex se, & per se tale fuerit. Quod tempore
id facit, fortasse ex aliquo accidenti huc est actum, ueluti iuueni
quadrati corporis. Tetano aestate media laboranti, frigida liberaliter
affusa caloris repercussum facit. Caeterum quod aqua frigida per se non
calefaciat, ex primo eius occursu patet. Sensum nanque inuehit frigoris.
Praeterea cutim quoad ei affunditur, frigefacit. Tum calorem nec in omni
corpore, nec dum affunditur inuehit. Imo tantum in iuuene, quadrati
corporis, & aestate media, & postquam a perfundendo est cessatum. Sicut
igitur frigida quibus incidit, haec illico perfrigerat, siue animata
corpora sunt, siue non animata, siue calida, siue frigida, ita si quod
esset tempus, uel corporis natura, uel affectus ullus, in quo frigida,
primo statim occursu caloris sensum inueheret, iure queri posset,
calefacere ne, an frigefacere per se nata esset. Nunc cum omnia tum
animata, tum inanimata protinus, & perpetuo frigefieri ab ea cernamus.
Quibus autem insitus calor, ueluti fons quidam ignis in uisceribus
est, his occurrens repercussum aliquando caloris facit, rationabile
arbitror ex accidenti, non per se talia calefacere. Sed nec latet qua
ratione illud accidat. Siquidem stipata, clusaque corporis summa facie,
repercussus, refractusque sit caloris eius, qui a profundo ascendit,
quique simul propter difflatus inopiam est aceruatus. Simul propter
frigidi circumstantis uiolentiam in altum recedit. Simul ex succis isthic
habitis nutritur. Quippe ubi collectus, nutritusque calor ad summa
corporis uiolentius ruit, fit quidem caloris repercussus, indicium uero
ac documentum quod frigida haud quaquam per se calorem auxit. Nam per se
quidem cutim perfrigerauit frigus uero eius, densitas, & reditus caloris
ad profundum sunt consecuti. Rursus horum, densitatem quidem difflatus
prohibitio. Reditum uero ad interiora, concoctio, consummatioque, qui
isthic sunt succorum, est adsecuta. Horum uero difflatus prohibitio,
caloris colligendi, succorum concoctio, eiusdem generandi fuit
occasio. Porro horum utrunque natiui, caloris sequitur auctio. Ergo
intercedentibus, & mediis utrisque, frigida in animalis corpore, caloris
aliquando excitat incrementum, per se nunquam. Sed non minus calor, est
quando ex accidenti perfrigerat. Vtique intercedente uacuatione. Sicut
perfusio phlegmonen. Cum enim ex calida fluxione phlegmone consistat,
propria quidem eius curatio, uacuatio superuacui est. Vacuationi
autem particulae, quae per phlegmonen excalfacta est, omnino succedit
refrigeratio. Ergo cum duplex in iis, quae phlegmone laborant particulis,
affectus sit, unus quidem in quantitate, ex superuacui naturae modum
exeuntis abundantia, alter in qualitate, qui ex caloris spectatur
ratione, sequitur prioris eorum curationem, etiam posterioris curatio:
fiuntque ex accidenti, quae uacuant, calentis materiae remedia, &
inflammationis particularum refrigeratoria, ergo tum haec discernere
oportet, tum id agere, ut pro modo simplicis affectus, etiam uirium
medicamenti inueniatur modus, uerbi gratia si calidus in summo affectus
sit, frigidum quoque in summo medicamentum paretur. Sin affectus a
summo paulum recedat, medicamentum quoque a summo paulum declinet. Si
plus a summo calore absit affectus, ad portionem absit a summo frigore
medicamen. Quippe si auspicatus a tali coniectura examen eorum sis,
facilius propriam, cuiusque inuenias uim. Ad summam enim in omni simplici
affectu calido, quodcunque adhibitum medicamen, primo statim occursu
frigoris sensum intulit, id frigidum potestate est. Ac multo profecto
magis, si post primam exhibitionem tale perpetuo manet. Quodsi calidum
affectum prorsus sanet, frigidum id ex necessitate fuerit. Adhibendum
uero est cum exploratur omnino tepidum, ut prius testati sumus. Vbi iam
cognitum est tale esse, deinde curationis causa petitur, rectius frigidum
sumitur. Nisi si medicamen summi sit frigoris, morbus in summo caloris
non sit. Atque haec quidem diffusius, tum in opere de medicamentis, tum
curandi methodo tradentur. Ad praesens illud saltem nouisse oportet. Si
quod calido, & simplici affectui adhibitum medicamentum, tum protinus,
tum toto deinceps tempore frigoris, sensum, ac facilioris tollerantiae,
iuuamentique laboranti affert, id frigidum necessario est. Tametsi
in aliis nonnunquam uideatur calidum. Deprehendetur enim in illis si
diligenter exploretur, non utique per se, sed ex accidenti excalfacere.
Cum per se dicimus, uel primum, uel nullo intercedente medio, omnibus
eiusmodi uerbis, idem potestate significamus. In quibus omnibus lectorem,
in opere de medicamentis propriis exemplis exercitabimus. Nunc
recensitis iis, quae ante iam dixi, proposito libro commodum imponere
finem tentabo. Cum nanque calidum corpus multifariam dicatur, nam & quod
summam eiusmodi habet in se qualitatem, ipsum scilicet elementum. Et quod
propter eiusmodi qualitatem pollentem, nomen est sortitum. Ad haec quod
colatum ad aliud dicitur, uel ad id quod mediocre eiusdem sit generis,
uel quicquid fors tulerit, sic & quod potestate calidum est, energia
uero nondum dici potest, intelligi, probarique multis modis oportet. Quo
utique minus recte siquid non statim inflammatur, id aliqui ne ut ad nos
quidem esse calidum potestate putant. Nam siue facile concoquitur, &
cito nutrit, erit ut ad nos calidum. Siue admotum ueluti medicamentum,
calefacit, erit id quoque, ut ad hominem potestate calidum. Sic nimirum
& per singulas animalis species, ipsum potestate calidum, siue est,
ut medicamentum, siue ut nutrimentum, ad illud tantum animal collatum
dicitur. Est enim ex iis, quae ad aliquid referuntur, quicquid potestate
aliquid dicitur. Quare & probatio, quae propria est, melior utique est,
quam quae ab externo petitur. Propria uero est una in singulis, utique
si celeriter tale fieri appareat, quale id esse potestate diximus. Est
enim potestate ignis, quicquid celeriter in ignem uertitur: potestate
uero calidum, ut ad hominem est, ex speciebus eorum, quae ex eo quod in
ipsis praepollet, dicuntur, quidquid homini applicatum, naturalis eius
caloris uel qualitatem auget, uel substantiam. Eadem mihi & de aliis
censeri dicta uelim, quaecunque scilicet potestate frigida, uel sicca,
uel humida dicuntur. Quum haec quoque partim ueluti ad ipsa elementa,
partim ueluti ad ea, quae ex praepollente sunt nominata, tum intelligi,
tum explorari, tum doceri conueniat. Patet uero eum quoque qui iudicat,
tactum, omnis acquisititii caloris & frigoris expertem esse debere,
sicuti de medicamentis ipsis prius est dictum.

    De temperamentis finis Thoma Linacro Anglo interprete




GALENI PERGAMENSIS De inaequali intemperie, Thoma Linacro Anglo interprete


Inaequalis intemperies alias in toto animalis corpore fit, ueluti in
ea hydropis specie, quam graeci ἀνασάρκα uocant. & febribus iis, quas
iidem hepialas appellant, fereque reliquis omnibus, exceptis, quas
Hecticas nominant. Incidit autem & in una qualibet parte, quum ea uel
intumuit, uel Phlegmone, Gangrena, Erisipilate, Cancro ue, est affecta.
Huc pertinet & qui Elephas dicitur, & Phagedena, & Herpes. Verum haec
omnia cum fluxione consistunt. Absque autem materiae affluxu, solis
partium qualitatibus aliquatenus alterandis, inaequales intemperies
fiunt, vtique refrigeratis iis, aut deustis, aut immodice exercitatis,
aut feriatis, aut aliquid id genus passis. Iam ex medicamentis iis,
quae foris corpori occurrunt, inaequalis intemperies gignitur, dum id
uel frigefit, uel calefit, vel siccatur, uel humectum redditur. Quippe
hae simplices intemperies sunt, veluti in iis, quae de temperamentis
scripsimus, est monstratum. Compositae ex iis aliae quatuor sunt, quum
corpus uel calefit simul & siccatur, uel calefit simul & humectatur, uel
refrigeratur simul & siccescit, uel refrigeratur pariter & madescit. Quod
autem eiusmodi intemperies ab aequalibus eo distent, quod in omnibus
intemperanter affecti corporis partibus aequaliter non insint: id clare
liquet. Ergo quis sit omnis inaequalis intemperaturae generandae modus,
in proposito libello statutum est exequi. Admonendi autem sumus, quo
clarior nobis omnis disputatio sit, de omnibus corporis particulis.
principio a maximis sumpto, quae scilicet ne vulgo quidem sunt ignotae.
Si quidem manus, & pedes, & uentrem, & thoracem, & caput nemo est qui
ignorat.

[Sidenote: Diuisio partium maiorum in sibi proximas.]

Diuidamus autem earum rursus unamquanque in proximas sui, quae προσεχῆ
graece dicuntur, particulas. Verbi gratia, crus in foemur, tibiam, &
pedem. Item totum brachium, in brachium, cubitum, & summam manum. Iam
manus ipsius particulae sunt, uola, & eius pars auersa, μετακάρπιον
graeci uocant, & digiti. Digitorum uero particulae sunt, ossa, cartilago,
ligamentum, arteria, uena, membrana, caro, tendo, unguis, cutis, adeps.
Has autem diuisisse in aliam speciem non est. Sed sunt similares, ac
primae, exceptis tamen arteriis et uenis.

[Sidenote: Arterias, & uenas partes esse compositas. Vacua spatia inter
singulas corporis partes intercedere. Quorum interposita spatia non
cernantur.]

Hae nanque ex fibris & membranis sunt conditae, ueluti in tractandae
dissectionis ratione est traditum. Quinetiam complura esse spatia inter
ipsas primas, & similares particulas, atque iis etiam plura maioraque
inter ipsas instrumentales, & compositas, aliqua uero et in una qualibet
similari particula, ueluti osse cuteque, haec quoque omnia in iis, quae
de administrandis dissectionibus scripsimus, sunt prodita. Ac quae mollia
quidem sunt corpora, ea quoniam sibi inuicem incumbunt, interposita
spatia latere conspectum faciunt. Quae dura siccaque sunt, in iis cernere
spatia licet, sicuti ossium cauernulas. Continent hae naturaliter multum
in sese humoris, huiusque albi, in id comparati ut ossa nutriat. Quae in
cute foramina sunt, ea, qua ratione fiant: in iis quae de temperamentis
precepimus, est dictum. Atque haec monuisse necessarium erat claritatis
causa eorum quae a nobis deinceps sunt dicenda. De inaequali uero
intemperie nunc agendum, tum quaenam eius natura sit, tum quot eius
generandae modi. Ergo quod, in omnibus particulis, corporis quod fluxione
est affectum, unica temperies non sit, prius est dictum. Verum id commune
omnis intemperamenti inaequalis est.

[Sidenote: Aliter simplicem carnem, Aliter uniuersum musculum inaequali
intemperie affectum esse.]

Differentiae eius, ipsam corporum affectorum sequuntur naturam, quum
aliter simplex caro aliter uniuersus musculus impari temperamento sit
affectus.

[Sidenote: Calidum reuma quemadmodum musculi partes inuadat.]

Quippe calida fluxio, ubi in musculum procubuit, primum maiores arteriae,
uenaeque opplentur, ac distenduntur. Ab iis minores. Atque ita res
procedit, donec ad minimas sit peruentum. In iis, ubi ualenter impacta
fluxio est, nec adhuc sistitur: partim eius per ipsarum ora, partim per
tunicas, ueluti colatum foras transmittitur. Tum uero spatia ipsa uacua,
quae inter prima sunt corpora, fluxione implentur. Sic omnia ab humore,
omnique ex parte incalescunt, ac perfunduntur.

[Sidenote: Venas & arterias in phlegmone uarie dolore.]

Ea sunt, nerui, ligamenta, membranae, caro ipsa, anteque haec
arteriae, & uenae. Quae scilicet & primae, & praeter caetera uario
dolore afficiuntur. Quippe interius a fluxione tum excalfiunt, tum
distenduntur, ac diuelluntur, exterius non modo excalfiunt: sed etiam
premuntur, ac degrauantur. Reliquae particulae aliae comprimendo solum,
uel incalescendo, aliae utroque genere laborant. Appellaturque morbus
ipse Phlegmonae. Est autem inaequalis intemperies musculi, feruet enim
iam qui in eo est sanguis. Is secum excalfacit primum quidem ac maxime
arteriarum, & uenarum tunicas. Mox uero omnia quae extra has sunt, quibus
scilicet circumfunditur. Ita duorum alterum necesse est sequi, ut si
fluxio uicerit, corruptio sequatur uictorum corporum, sin fluxio sit
uicta: ut musculi ad naturalem statum redeant.

[Sidenote: Victa fluxione, quae deinde curatio.]

Esto igitur prius uicta fluxio (rectius enim a melioribus incipitur).
Duplex hic incidit curationis genus, quod uel digeretur quidquid humoris
in particulam procubuit, uel concoquetur.

[Sidenote: Digestionem in phlegmone maxime optandam esse curationem.
Concoctionem phlegmonis duo sequi. Spatiorum in quae absceditur uaria
genera. Abscessionum quae melior sit quae deterior.]

Verum digestio optanda maxime curatio est. Concoctionem haec duo
necessario sequuntur, puris generatio, & eius in aliquod spatium
abscessio. Abscedit aliquando in capacitatum quae propinquae sunt, tum
maximam, tum minime momentaneam. Quod sane abscessionis genus optimum
est. Alias in non momentaneam quidem, non tamen maximam. Interim in
maximam, non tamen non momentaneam. Ac quae in uentriculum incidunt
abscessionum, optima est quae in sinum eius internum abit. In quem etiam
plerunque se aperiunt. Mala uero quae sub peritoneum. Pari modo in iis
quae circa cerebrum existunt, bona est quae in priores eius uentriculos
abscedit. Mala quae sub inuolucra eius. Item quae in posticum eius
uentrem se recipit. Qui uero circa costas abscessus colliguntur: hi in
capacitates erumpunt pectoris. Ac musculorum quidem abscessus sub cutem,
uiscerum uero in arterias & uenas, quas in se continent, uel in membranam
qua operiuntur, quae ipsis pro cute est.

[Sidenote: Si uicta pars a fluxione sit.]

At si uictae a fluxione particulae fuerint, in tantam deuenient
intemperiem, unde tum earum pereat actio, tum ipsae spatio corrumpantur.

[Sidenote: Dolor quando desinat. Quando doleant corpora.]

Porro desinent tum primum dolere, quum mutatrici qualitati fuerint
adsimilatae. Non enim quum mutata particularum temperies iam est, siue
(ut sic loquar) in ipso mutatum esse, dolent, sed dum mutantur, siue in
ipsa mutatione.

[Sidenote: Hippocrates.]

Quemadmodum mirus dixit Hippocrates. “Dum alterascit ac corrumpitur
natura: dolores fiunt. Alteratur autem, ac corrumpitur cuiusque natura,
quum uel calefit, uel frigefit, uel siccatur, uel humefit, uel eius
unitas dissoluitur. In iis quidem intemperamentis quae inaequalia sunt,
ex calefaciendo, uel ex frigefaciendo. Quippe quum efficacissimae
qualitates hae sint. Secundo loco e siccando, uel humectando. Ex
esuriendo uero uel sitiendo, deficiente hic humida, illic sicca
substantia. Ex uulnerando, & erodendo, & tendendo, & premendo, &
conuellendo: unitate ipsa soluenda. Ergo si calor sanguinis in particula,
quae phlegmone laborat, mitis est: tum qui in toto animalis est corpore
mediocriter attemperatus: non facile una cum afflicta particula calefit,
sin uel ille feruet uehementius, uel qui per totum spargitur animal,
biliosus est: illico totus ad calorem uertitur. Multo uero magis sicubi
ambo concurrunt, ut & qui in phlegmone habetur admodum calidus sit, & qui
in toto est animante biliosus.

[Sidenote: In phlegmone quis sanguis primum calefiat, quis deinceps.]

Porro calefit primum qui in arteriis est sanguis, quod scilicet is tum
natura calidior, tum uero magis spirituosus sit, post hunc uero etiam qui
in uenis est. Quod si in propinqua uisceri, cui plurimus sit sanguis,
obsessa phlegmone particula fuerit: iam celerius cum hoc uniuersus qui in
animali est sanguis calore afficitur.

[Sidenote: Quid citius, & quid tardius alteretur tum generatim tum
membratim.]

Vnoque uerbo, quidquid ex facili alterabile est, aut calidum natura:
id a quouis calefaciente primum excalfit. Non secus & ab eo quod
frigefacit, quidquid facile alteratu est, uel natura frigidum: id primum
refrigeratur. Ac promptus quidem ad alterandum spiritus est. Vtpote ex
tenuissimis constans partibus. Calidissima naturae merito est flaua
bilis. At frigidissima pituita est. Reliquorum humorum, sanguis post
flauam bilem maxime est calidus, sicut nigra bilis post pituitam est
frigida. Quinetiam alteratur flaua bilis leui momento, ex quouis in eam
agente. Nigra aegre alterascit. In summa quidquid tenuium est partium,
id prompte alteratur: contra cui crassae sunt partes, aegre.

[Sidenote: Alterationis uarietates in phlegmonis, ex quinque generibus
accidere.]

Ita necesse est multifariae phlegmonis alterationes incidant, propterea
quod multifariam affecta sunt corpora. Principio nanque succus qui
phlegmonen excitat, magis minusue calidus est, deinde succi putrefactio,
pro ipsius natura respondet, non minimum certe prout is magis minusue est
impactus. Quippe quae perspiratu carent, celerius putrescunt, ueluti & in
externis accidit omnibus. Caeterum quum calida temperie sunt & humida,
tum utique potissimum. Iam ipsa phlegmone laborans particula, uel prope
uel longe sita est, a multi sanguinis uisceribus, totusque sanguis
uel biliosus est, uel melancholicus, uel pituitosus, uel spirituosus.
Atque haec omnia magis minusque. Quare necesse est multiformes fieri
alterationes, siue alterum alteri sit collatum, siue idem sibi.

[Sidenote: In corpore quod phlegmone laboret, quid maxime inflammetur,
quid deinde.]

Fiunt hae omnes inaequales corporis intemperies, maxime quidem inflammato
eo qui in phlegmone est sanguine, deinde eo qui in uisceribus habetur
& corde. Atque huius maxime eo qui in sinistro eius sinu est. In quem
(sicut in opere de usurpandis manu dissectionibus est dictum) si uiuo
etiam animante, nec adhuc febre tentato, dimittere digitum uelis:
uehementissimum deprehendes calorem. Quo magis uerisimile est, ubi totum
corpus praeter naturam incalescit: hunc maxime sinum ad summum peruenire
caloris. Quippe quum tenuissimum maximeque spirituosum sanguinem habeat,
ac moueatur perpetuo. Caeterum in febribus id genus omnibus, calefit
quidem sanguis aliquando uniuersus, quicunque non naturalem illum
calorem, qui ex humoris putrescentia est obortus, concoepit. Non tamen
aut arteriarum, uenarum ue tunicae, aut aliud ullum circumiacentium
corporum, prorsus iam temperamentum suum mutauit, sed adhuc mutatur atque
alteratur incalescens, siue (ut sic loquar) calefiens. Quod longiore
tempore hoc patitur, etiam uincetur aliquando, prorsusque mutabitur, ita
ut non amplius calefiat, sed iam sit praeter naturam calefactum.

[Sidenote: Terminus alterationis quis statuendus.]

Porro terminus mutationis est, cuiusque particulae functionis lesio.
Ad quem usque terminum omnis alterationis latitudo: via est in id quod
praeter naturam est, veluti mixtum communeque ac medium quiddam ex
contrariis vtrisque compositum, ipso naturali prorsus affectu, & eo qui
iam plane est praeter naturam.

[Sidenote: Doloris in febri spatium, & eius terminus.]

Ergo toto hoc tempore corpus incalescens: pro modo alterationis etiam ad
portionem sentit dolorem. Quum vero omnes corporis solidae particulae
excalfactae ad absolutionem iam sunt, eiusmodi febrem Hecticam graeci
vocant, ceu non amplius iam in humoribus & spiritu: sed in corporibus iis
quae habitus rationem habent, comprehensam.

[Sidenote: Indolescentiae in hecticis causa.]

Haec doloris est expers, putantque qui ea febricitant, omnino se febre
carere. neque enim sentiunt eius calorem. omnibus scilicet eorum partibus
aeque percalfactis. Sed & conuenit de iis, inter naturalis scientiae
professores in iis quae de sensibus produnt.

[Sidenote: Doloris in febribus causa.]

Neque enim citra alterationem est sensus, neque in iis quae iam ad
perfectionem sunt alterata, dolor. Itaque etiam hecticae febres omnes,
tum sine dolore sunt: tum nec sensu ab his qui ipsis laborant, perceptae.
Non enim ex eorum particulis, haec agit haec patitur. quum omnes inter se
iam similes sint redditae, ac vnicam habeant consentientem temperiem.

[Sidenote: Hypophora & solutio.]

Quod si alia earum calidior est, alia frigidior: at certe eatenus est
frigidior, ut uicinam nihil offendat. Alioqui sic scilicet partes quae
pro naturae modo se habent: mutuo se offenderent, vtpote qui sic saltem
temperamentis dissideant. Caro nanque calida particula est, os frigidum.

[Sidenote: Inaequalitas temperamenti in sanis indolens est.]

Caeterum tam harum partium, quam reliquarum omnium indolens inaequalitas
est, modi excessus merito. Sic nanque nec aer qui nos ambit, prius
offendit: quam ad immodicum calorem frigusue est immutatus. Cuius alioqui
quae in medio sunt differentias, tametsi numerosas, ac manifestum
excessum inter se habentes, citra noxam sentimus.

[Sidenote: Hippo. dictum et eiusdem nonnulla probabilitas.]

Ex iis ergo fortasse nec illud durius dici videatur, quod Hippocrates
alicubi ait: “Omnem morbum vlcus esse. Quippe vlcus vnitatis est
diuisio. Immodicus vero calor ac frigus proxime accedunt, vt vnitatem
soluant, plurimus quidem calor, dum segregat ac diuidit substantiae
continuitatem, summum vero frigus, tum stipando tum introrsus pariter
trudendo, quaedam exprimit, quaedam quassat. Atque hunc quispiam immodici
caloris ac frigoris terminum statuens, fortasse non incommode sentiat.

[Sidenote: Omnem immodicum excessum ad aliquid esse.]

Seu vero is siue alius immodici excessus terminus est, certe consistere
omnem immoderatum excessum in habitudine ad aliquid, iam liquet. Non enim
pari ratione a calidis frigidisque afficitur omne corpus.

[Sidenote: Animalium quaedam conuenientes, quaedam contrarios inter se
succos habere.]

Indeque fit ut aliqua animalium conuenientes inter se succos habeant,
aliqua non solum non conuenientes, sed etiam qui se mutuo corrumpant,
veluti homo atque vipera, quorum utriusque saliua alteri est pernities.
Ita vtique & scorpium necaueris, si ieiunus illi inspueris. At non homo
hominem morsu interemit, nec uipera uiperam, nec aspis aspidem. Siquidem
quod simile est: id congruum amicumque est, quod contrarium est, inimicum
ac noxium. Augetur enim quidque ac nutritur a similibus, perimitur ac
corrumpitur a dissimilibus. Itaque etiam sanitatis tutela per similia
perficitur, morborum sublatio per contraria. Verum de iis alius est sermo.

[Sidenote: Omnem febrem praeter hecticem a laborante sentiri.]

Hecticam uero febrem quae iam habitum corporis occupauit, minime sentit
qui ea laborat. Reliquarum febrium nulla est quae non a laborante
sentiatur. sed aliae magis aliae minus aegrotanti sunt graues. Sunt
ex iis & quae rigorem ingerant, sit enim id quoque symptoma, veluti
alia multa, ab inaequali intemperie. Rationem tamen generandi eius in
proposito libro tradere non est, priusquam de naturalibus facultatibus
demonstratum fuerit, quot hae qualesque sint, tum quid agere quaeque
sit nata. Verum in libris de symptomatum causis, de omnibus agetur. Sed
reuertor ad inaequalis intemperamenti differentias. Nam quemadmodum ex
phlegmone febris nascatur, tum quod febris omnis ac phlegmone omnis,
praeter hecticas, ex morbis sint, quibus inaequalis sit intemperies:
dictum iam est.

[Sidenote: Inaequalis intemperamenti generandi uariae rationes.]

Porro accendi febrem & citra phlegmonen ex solis humoribus putrescentibus
licet. Neque enim ea solum que inculcata sunt, & perspiratu prohibita,
putrescunt. verum celeriter ea, maximeque. Caeterum putrescunt & alia
multa, quae putredini sunt opportuna. Dicetur vero de horum opportunitate
alio loco. Iam alio quoque genere inaequalis oriri intemperies in toto
corpore potest, modo fuliginoso vapore detento, modo exercitationibus
& plusculis laboribus calore adaucto, modo ab ira, quum sanguis
immoderatius feruet, modo ex deustione quauis externa, incalescit. Porro
quod etiam in his omnibus febribus, non secus quam in phlegmonis supra
est dictum, tum pro uiribus effectricis causae, tum pro corporis ipsius
affectu, alii magis febricitent, alii minus, alii haud quaquam, apertum
esse arbitror. Aeque vero et quod intemperies ipsa nonnunquam spirituosam
tantum inuadit substantiam, nonnunquam ipsos etiam succos, clarum id
quoque reor. Sed nec minus illud, quod omnibus huiusmodi febribus si
traxerint, hectica superueniet. Iamque sermo noster propemodum ostendit,
inaequalem hanc intemperiem aliquando ex calida, frigida ve substantia,
quae in particulam aliquam influat, accidere, veluti in his fiebat, quos
phlegmonae infestat.

[Sidenote: Corporis temperies quando extrinsecus, et quando interne
alteretur.]

Sepe non ita: sed ipsa corporis temperie in qualitate mutata, tum
quod alterantium eam, quaedam ortum habeant ab ipso corpore, quaedam
extrinsecus, vtique quum ex putredine tantum aliqua, vel phlegmone
excitatur febris, ab ipso corpore, quum ab vstione vel exercitatione,
extrinsecus. Dicetur autem et de his fusius in morborum causis. Tanquam
autem ex deustione accenditur febris, alterato videlicet corporis
temperamento: itidem nonnulli sepe ex frigore refrigerati toto corpore
vehementer sunt, aliqui vero etiam perierunt. Iam quod hi omnes etiam
doleant, ne id quidem latet. Porro dolent et qui ex rigore ingenti
vehementer perfrigerati, celeriter sese excalfacere properarunt, multique
eorum quum subito ac simul manus igni admouerunt, ingentem circa vnguium
radicem sentiunt dolorem. Et quisquam quum tam luculenter videat
intemperiem inaequalem doloris esse causam: etiam de internis doloribus
dubitet, aut miretur, quo pacto citra phlegmonen, subinde uel laxiore
intestino, quod colon graeci uocant, uel dentibus, uel alia quauis
particula homines doleant? Nam neque talium ullum mirabile est, nec
quemadmodum simul rigeant et febricitent aegrotantium aliqui.

[Sidenote: Cur aliqui simul rigeant, et febricitent.]

Quippe si pituitosus succus qui frigidus est, quemque Praxagoras uitreum
appellat, et amara bilis quae calida est, simul abundent, ac per
sensibilia membra moueantur: nihil miri est utrumque a cubante pari modo
sentiri. Neque enim si hominem sub sole feruido statuas, et aquam illi
frigidam infundas, fieri potest, ut non simul et a sole calorem, et ab
aqua frigus sentiat. Verum hoc casu ambo extrinsecus sunt, nec paruis
portionibus incidunt.

[Sidenote: In hepialis cur frigus et calor simul sentiantur.]

In febribus quas hepialos uocant, tum ab interno, tum exiguis
portionibus, eoque uniuersum corpus ambo sentire uidetur. Quum enim
tenuissimis portiunculis aspersum per corpus tum calidum sit tum
frigidum: nullam sensilem alterius portiunculam ita paruam desumas, in qua
non alterum sit comprehensum.

[Sidenote: In accessionum inuasione febricitantes aliquos frigus et
calorem simul sentire.]

In ipsa tamen accessionis inuasione, aliqui febricitantium tum rigent,
tum uero febricitant, tum ambo sentiunt, frigus immodicum, et calorem
una. Verum non eodem loco. Quippe quum possint quae excalfactae sunt
partes, manifeste a refrigeratis discernere. Nam intus et in ipsis
uisceribus calorem sentiunt. In externis partibus uniuersis frigus.

[Sidenote: In Lipyriis utrumque perpetuo ita ut in accessionibus sentiri.]

Tales perpetuo febres sunt et quae graece Lipyriae uocantur. Praeterea
quoddam ardentium febrium perniciosum genus. Quod igitur in his
maioribus portionibus accidit, hoc in hepialis contingit minutis.
Inaequalis nanque est et harum febrium intemperies, sed nec minus
reliquarum omnium, exceptis tamen hecticis.

[Sidenote: Aliquos rigere nec tamen febricitare Rarumque id.]

Quinetiam iis qui rigent, nec tamen febricitant, inaequale temperamentum
est. Rarum tamen est id symptoma. Caeterum incidit tum mulieribus, tum
quibusdam aliquando uiris. Debet autem omnino deses praecessisse uita,
aut certe ciborum copiam longiore spatio homo sumpsisse, ex quibus
tardus, frigidus, crudus, & pituitosus nascatur succus, qualem scilicet
Praxagoras uitreum existimat.

[Sidenote: Symptoma priscis (vt videtur) ignotum, et cur.]

Porro antiquitus nemo (ut uidetur) ita est affectus, utqui nec adeo
ociosi, nec in uictus saturitate uiuerent. Indeque factum est, ut
scripserint antiqui medici, rigori febrem necessario superuenire.
Verumtamen tum nos ipsi, tum alii iuniorum medicorum non pauci,
sepenumero uidimus rigorem, quem nulla secuta sit febris.

[Sidenote: Hepialos quae vocetur.]

Porro componitur ex hac intemperie, et ea quae febricitantium est,
Hepialus. appello ita febrem illam, cui ambo semper accidunt. At in qua
rigor quidem praecedit, febris sequitur, ueluti in tertianis & quartanis
hanc hepialum non voco. Ita ex duplici inaequali intemperie hepialus
componitur. Etiam aliae febres praeter hecticas fere omnes. Simili genere
qui particulae alicuius cum tumore morbi sunt, hi quoque omnes perinde ac
phlegmonae, cum intemperamento inaequali consistunt. Cancer, Erisipelas,
Carbunculus, Herpes, Tumor, Phagedena, Gangrena. Quippe commune iis
omnibus est, vt ex fluxione humorum sint orta. Dissident in eo quod
alii ex pituitoso, alii ex bilioso, vel melancholico succo, alii ex
sanguine vel calido, vel tenui, vel bulliente, vel frigido, vel crasso,
vel alio quopiam genere affecto fiant. Declarabitur enim alio loco de
horum membratim differentia diligenter. Quod ad propositam disceptationem
pertinet, hoc tantum dixisse abunde est, quod qualiscunque est fluxio,
eadem ratione, quemque praedictorum affectuum creat, qua prius ex
calida et sanguinea phlegmonen gigni monstrauimus. Sed non minus etiam
similarium, ac simplicium, primorumque in iis corporum singula, sic
a fluxione affecta, ad inaequalem intemperiem deuenient. Caeterum
extrinsecus pro reumatis ratione calefacta, refrigerata, siccata, vel
humectata, penitus et in profundo nondum similiter affecta. Quod si tota
per tota mutata alterataque sint: fiunt quidem illico a dolore libera.
In difficili tamen sic constituta sunt statu. Hec praenouisse his qui
opus de medicamentis sunt percepturi, et post id medendi methodum, abunde
mihi satis videtur.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
