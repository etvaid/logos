J ſhall begin with my birth, as no man 
has a title to write a volume before he 
was born, but my friend Triſtram

improper to appoint ſome friend to write 
an account of my death, when it happens; 
to let the world know I am, bona fide, 
dead; as, by telling them I was born, 
I may eſcape being taken for the Unborn

full, I ſhall again repeat it, that my mo- 
ther wore a watch, and to make you ſtare 
the more, know it was a repeater. But 
your firſt obſervation of its having an odd 
ſound was very juſt; for the hell being 


crack'd, it really did ſound oddly ; how- - | 
ever, neither the hour. or minute hand 


were crack'd, but each performed the

of the hands in the publick offices of the 
neighbouring kingdoms. As for my 


own country's politicians, I ſhall-ſay no-

it is faſhionable, be imdlined to find fault, 
with or without reaſon; juſt as blind

Hold, hold, ſays à grave reader, with

ſhall give more than I promiſed of what 
you did not, tho? ſo very little of — what

own inventing. I have long had a diſ- 
like to thoſe titles of every chapter, which, 
like Orator Henley's puffs, often, in ten 
words, contain more than the ten ſuc- 
ceeding dull pages make good ; there- 
fore, though mine, agreeable to the reign- 
ing taſte, muſt have a title, yet you ſhall 
no more be able to gueſs at the contents

ſhrugs foretold it; if attended with ill 
fucceſs, the ſame ſhrugs plainly demon- 
ſtrated it. Thus will it fare with the rea- 
der in regard to the heads of my chap- 
ters. If they by chance let you into the 
truth, I deſigned it; if they lead you 
aſtray, that I likewiſe intended. You

ſtill perſuade myſelf, that they are all 
either wilfully blind, or lack penetration ; 
ſo that, to preſerve their own want of ca- 
pacity from being expoſed, they have

ſneer, repeat, Meæ virtute me involuam. 
An honeſt parſon of my acquaintance 
often concludes ſo, when he is at (what 


you ſcholars call) his ne plus; though I 


often think he had much better wrap 
himſelf up (in cold weather eſpecially) in 
his cloak than his virtue, the former be- 
ing much the warmer covering of the 
two; for of the latter, to my certain 
knowledge, the pattern's too ſcant to 
wrap a grain of muſtard-ſeed in. But 
no matter for that, the ſentence has a 
fine ſmooth found, eſpecially from a man 
that ſpeaks Latin with a good accent — 
Tour univerſity declaimers have great 
advantages over us country puts, who

caſe till the age of fourteen ; I then went 
from ſchool to buſineſs, and from that, to 
this preſent time, which is fourteen years

either a Latin or a Greek author ; ſo that, 
my {lender ſhare of both languages muſt 
have ſpun out very well, if I have as 
much left as will lay upon an old groat ; 
and that, let me tell you, is a few grains 
more than I have often found within a

ended in making an author, againſt na-

ſaying, I don't write to pleaſe you learn-

much money, and a moderate ſhare of 
learning, and a great deal of good-nature : 
if any of theſe find fault with me, the 
reproof will touch me nearly; but, your 
barking and ſnarling, worthy gentlemen, 
I ſhall pay as much regard to them, as 
my neighbour the gardener's dog: keeper:

bour's Spaniſh lap-dog. I did indeed once 
ſee him lift a leg, after being teazed for 
half an hour together ; but that's a fa- 
vour I ſhall hardly be provoked to con- 
fer on any of you: ſo fall to work as 
ſoon as you will; you may do it with 
impunity, no anſwer ſhall you have 
from me; but the more you ſay, the 
more ſhall I perſuade myſelf, that ye are 
very hungry: and, as to the Monthly

HE Reviewers, I find, in the laſt 

chapter, are very deſirous to know 
how I got into print? - Why, as they got 
together to print a monthly book, hunger 
drove me to print — And, if hunger 
did not lay the foundation of their league, 
there's more than one miſtaken; but that's 
nothing to the purpoſe. Hunger, ſay 
they, could not get a man credit for paper 
and printing : there they are right; I with 
every thing they ſaid had as good an ap- 
pearance of reaſon and truth; but, "ſince

tlemen all the ſatisfaction I can. Hunger, 


I ſaid, drove me to the thoughts both of 


tranſlating and printing: the tranſtating 
I found an eaſy taſk, by the help of my 
good Jandlady in Porridge Ifland ; who, 
ſeeing me ſo induſtrious, conſented to 
truſt me both my board and lodging, till 
had got ſomething ready for the preſs; 
I went on ſwimmingly, with hot tripe 
for dinner one day, and cold the next ; 
hot cow-heel the third day, and cold 
cow-heel the fourth; and ſo on, with a 
fine peaſe ſoup on Sundays, and a red 
herring boiled in it to give a flavour: 
thus, I ſay, I went on ſwimmingly, till 
the printing time came; but in that ar- 


ticle my poor landlady was utterly unable 


to help me to a ſingle ſouſe: her whole 


ſtock of money, which conſiſted of near 


half a guinea, being employed every 
day in buying goods to furniſh her 
wheelbarrow ; with the profits of which,

three times a week we had a pint of beer 
betwixt us — Finding that I could, in 
conſcience, expect little aſſiſtance from 
her towards defraying the expence of 
printing my works, I was obliged to put 
as gond a face on the matter as poſſible, 
and go and try my luck with the book- 
ſellers. The. firſt J accoſted was Mr. 
— in the I told him, I had 
brought him the firſt, ſecond, third, and 
fourth books of Homer's Iliad, tranſlated 
in a different manner from any he had 
ever ſeen; which I would leave for his 
peruſal, provided he would give me his 
word and honour (I mentioned the word 
honour, becauſe I know ſeveral book- 
ſellers that pretend to have a little) that 
if he did not chuſe to riſk the printing. 
he would not ſuffer a copy to be taken 
of it — Whether the word honour ſtun'd 
his ears, or what the d—] was the mat-

ter I can't tell; but he ſtared at me above 
two minutes with his mouth at half cock, 
meaſuring me all the time from head to 
foot with his eyes. Zounds! thinks I to 
myſelf, this fellow's an undertaker, inſtead 
of a bookſeller, or elle a taylor; for he 
is either taking meaſure of me for a ſuit 
of cloaths, or a coffin ; but I was out in 
both; for he was only taking the depth 
of my pocket. His firſt queſtion was, I 
hope, Sir, you are able to defray the expence 
of printing? I told him no; I defigned 
the riſk to be his, for which a propor- 
tionable ſhare of the profits would be 
due to him likewiſe : upon this he put 
on a mighty wiſe face ; thruſt his hand 
betwixt his head and his wig, ſcratching, 
as if he took pleaſure in the amuſement ; 
rubb'd his forehead, and ſtroaked his 
eyebrows with his fore-finger ; then look- 
ing full upon me, That, Sir, ſays he, is,

plied in the affirmative: Pray, Sir, ſays 
he, very demurely, do you underſtand 
Greek ? I gave a ſudden jump back, and 
in my turn began to ſtare at him; I 
thought I had as good a right to mea- 
ſure his head as he my pockets ; and, I 
believe, I took four minutes to do it; 
then, with much difficulty, got out the 
words, Greek, Sir! ſays I, what lan- 
guage do you think I have been tran- 
ſlating from? Why, I can't ſay, quoth 
he, (ſpinning the words through his 
teeth) but, as we have a Greek Homer, a 
Latin Homer, and an Engliſh Homer, 
you may have had your choice from which 
to tranſlate : Zounds, Sir! ſays I, do 
you think I have had a library as large, 
and as well ſtock'd as your ſhop to go to; 
but you are out, I aſſure you, nor have 
I a book left in the world but this old

been loſt, it had gone long ago with the 
reſt; but the pick and chuſe for two- 
pence man refuſed to give me a penny 
for it; though that day I was almoſt fa- 
miſhed, but the rogues have, againſt 
their will, I hope, done both the world 
and me great ſervice, by forcing me to 
keep it; for, as I had only that one 
book to amuſe my leiſure hours, I have 
been enabled to compleat ſuch a tranſla- 
tion, as Pope himſelf never dreamt on; 
and, I don't fear, but it will anſwer 
ſa well as to pay you for your riſk, 
and me for my trouble, far beyond 
the moſt ſanguine expectation. As 
for my riſk, Sir, ſays he, with an 
aldermanic air, I ſhall be plain with 
you, becauſe I find you come directly to 
the point; as to my riſk, Sir, I never 
run any: the town is very capricious ; 
one year they'll take it into their heads 

to

to like a thing, and cry an author up to 
the ſky, and the next year damn a bet- 
ter, or at leaſt as good, from the ſame 
hand, only becaufe they grow weary of 


praiſing; therefore, Sir, I always chuſe, 


if an author han't money of his own, 
which very feldom happens, to make him- 
find ſome friend to anſwer the loſs, in 


_ caſe I am obliged to deal by wholeſale

won't line one ammunition trunk, For 
that reaſon, replied my ſteady-phiz'd 
bookſeller, they won't be worth a hun- 
dred farthings ; but I'll be generous with 
you, much more ſo than you'll find any

come to a ſecond, your friend will be 
quite free of his engagement, and you. 
be ſome {mall matter in pocket. I knew 
I could as ſoon raiſe the dead as a friend, 
to anſwer for any ſum above ſix-pence, 
though I ſcorned to let him know ſo 
much of the matter ; for to be poor, and- 
look poor, is the d—l. I told him, I 
would not trouble any of my friends for 
ſuch a trifle; and, if a bookſeller could 
not be found that would, on peruſal, 
run the riſk, I would not give myſelf 
much trouble about it; but if you, Sir, 
adds I, had put peruſed this tranſlation, 
you could not wrong your own judgment 


ſo much, I am certain, as to fear its not 


anſwering. As to my own judgment, 
anſwers Mr. Square-toes, I never truſted 
it but once, and then was moſt horribly 
deceived; ſo I never truſted it ſince, nor 
ever will again. If you can meet with 
a bookſeller that will, you'll have very

good luck; but, ſhould you find ſuch a 
phenomenon, it will be no ſmall ſurprize, 
both to me and the whole fraternity; and 
ſo, Sir, Pm your very humble ſervant. 
Away goes I from this worthy gentle- 
man bookſeller, in no great ſpirits, you 
may think; and, after trying about 
twenty at leaſt, of the very ſame ſtamp, 
Providence directed me to the real worthy 
Mr. Goodman, who, upon hearing my 
tale with a great deal of patience, made 
me this moſt extraordinary anſwer; Sir, 
ſays he, there is a calve's head and bacon 
Juſt gone up into the dining-room, if 
you will eat a bit you are welcome; a 
glaſs of wine after it will refreſh your 
ſpirits; for you ſeem fatigued; I'll then 
contrive to do you what ſervice I can. 1

that I pinched my arms, to convince me

ſuperior being. I followed him, how- 
ever, without heſitation; the ſmell of 
the calf's head and bacon had taken entire 
poſſeſſion of my ſenſes ; and I really was 
entertained, if I live to the age of Ma- 
thuſelah, I never ſhall forget it. At 
parting, with the countenance of a che- 
rubim, he ſaid, Sir, I judge of your im- 
patience to try the ſucceſs of your works, 
I'll therefore read them over this evening; 
and, if there's the leaſt chance of its tak- 
ing, I'll print it at my own expence; nor 
will I take an exorbitant profit for a tri- 
fling riſk : trifling, I call it, becauſe we 
have a thouſand ways of vending all 
kinds of ſtuff, at leait to make as much 
as will pay for print and paper: and, 
Sir, whatever my brethren of the trade 
may think, grinding the face of the poor, 
to me, appears the greateſt piece of in- 
humanity man can be guilty of; and, to 

grind a poor poet, 1s grinding the pooreſt

in ſilver into my hand, adds, in a ſofter 
tone, I would have you give my ſervant 
a ſhilling as you go down; the knave 
will be ready to attend you at the ſtair- 
Foot; it is a cuſtom we cannot break in 
England ; and I would preſerve every 
gentleman from being inſulted by their 
inſolent ſneers.

live though to make him amends; my 
heart feels comfort in that hope yet. —

my ſtory, I had almoſt forgot. — In the 
morning I waited on him again; found 
him at breakfaſt ; got a comfortable diſh 
of tea, and eat fix pieces of toaſt and 
butter; which went down more plea- 
ſantly, becauſe this real worthy man, de- 
ſirous not to keep me in ſuſpence, ſays, 
the moment I was ſeated, Sir, your

hands of my printer; I read it over laſt 
night, and gave it him this morning:

prodigious reputation, and the doctors 
cried him vp to the ſkies; and good rea-

I ſaw him thrive ſo well, I never could 
perſuade myſelf to follow his example,

ficulty every half year than others in pay-

began to ſtare me in the face; and yet, 
wich a murrain to me, I could not per- 
ſuade myſelf to change my opinion: I

knew very well, from a ſpeech made by 
one of the faculty at a meeting, to con-

CHAP. VI. 


Containing my brother Gallypot's notable 
ſpeech, and ſome ſmall mat ters beſides. 


Entlemen, we are met here upon a 
very ſerious affair, and what highly 
concerns the welfare of all regular apo- 
thecaries z it is no leſs than the utter ex- 
tirpation of quacks out of this kingdom. 
I have often urged before this to have a 
meeting of the faculty called, in order to 
raiſe a ſubſcription to petition the par- 
lament for leave to bring in a bill, de- 
claring every man that dare advertiſe, to 
be neither more nor leſs than a quack ; 
and, 


„ Þt 


and, if any man dies after taking the 
medicines of a quack, he fhall be de- 
clared ela de ſe, and refuſed the rights of 
Chriſtian burial: I am ſure we have in- 

tereſt enough in the Houſe to get ſuch a 
bill paſſed, which would drive James 
and his powders to the d—1 ; then would 
fevers walk the ſtreets in broad day- 

light as formerly, without fear of being. 
demoliſhed by patent powders ; patients. 
would look meagre, and apothecaries. 
plump; whereas it is now quite the re- 

verſe, patients look plump, and apothe- 


Caries ſo thin, a man would be apt to 


imagine they took their own phyſick ;. 
nay, there's hardly a ſtreet that cannot 
furniſh ane, if not two properly quali- 
fied, to act the. apothecary's part in Ro- 
meo and Juliet. What adds to our miſ- 
fartune is, mankind can have little or no- 
idea of the miſery of a ſtarving apothe- 
- eary — Butchers, if their cuſtom fails, 
can 


Ee 


48 TE AUTHOR'?S 


can eat their own beef and mutton, and 
their wives ſteal now and then a pair of 
lamb- ſtones: poulterers can grow fat” 
with feeding on their own ducks and 
coneys : fiſnmongers get their bellies full 
of ſtale ling, and indulge their wives with 
cods, when in ſeaſon : paſtry-cooks may” 
gobble up their own cuſtards; and gro- 
cers eat their own figs, except one they 
commonly ſpare for their wives: green- 
grocers wives may cram in their own 
carrots; and bakers regale with butter'd 
buns ; even maſons wives, though they 
can make no ule of their huſband's chips, 
yet can find great uſe for the ſtones ; but 
poor apothecaries will ſooner ſtarve than 
touch one article in their own ſhops. 
Think then, gentlemen, what a deplo- 
rable caſe this is, and how loud it calls 
for immediate redreſs. For my part, tho 
I am plumper than ſeven eighths of my 
brethren ; yet I ride, pardon me, I mean 
I walk 


"P85 820 TH 49 


walk, but bare ten ſtone. As for riding, 
J have not been able to hire a horſe theſe 
five years: but, I ſay, though I am 
plumper than moſt of my brethren, yet, 
even a diſtant proſpect of their diſtreſs 
alarms me; and I would chearfully con- 


tribute half a guinea, or even more, upon 


this occaſion, to remedy ſo dreadful an 
evil. 


This harangue made a very ſenſible 
impreſſion on me; what it did on the 
reſt of the company I won't ſay ; but L 
perceived ſeveral long faces, as well as 


my own ; I plainly foreſaw approaching 


ruin, and yet knew not which way to 
ſhun it without changing my principles, 


ſequence z for, in about twelve months 
after, my empty boxes and houſhald 
goods were juſt able to pay my debts, 


E not

than give up. And ſtarving was the con-

it was then I began to think of a new

which ſtill is ſo kind as to ſtick cloſe by 
my ſide, has directed me to the trade [ 
have now taken up; and which, it is 
more than probable, proves the more 
ſtarving buſineſs of the two. 


And now, O ye generation of criticks ! 
fall to work, and make the moſt you can 
of a ftarved apothecary, as much a race 
of Canibals as ye are, you'll have bur a

And ſneak'd in ſilence to his place. 
Then might you hear the mob declare

Up to the ſtars they cry'd Ulyſſes,

And quickly eat eight young ones up 
To make the ninth, there wants another; 
On which the ſerpent ſnapp'd the mother,

HOMER'S 1LIA Ps. 155 


The love, the ſmile, the pleaſing air, 
Contriv'd to pleaſe the beauteous fair, 
Are bleſſings which the gods beſtow, 
Only ta favourites below: 
Yet, if it pleaſe thee, I will ſtand, 

This cuckold's combat hand to hand: 
His flaming weapon Paris ſcorns, 

He only fears the cuckold's horns ; 

For ſhould theſe mighty antlers gore him, 
Pray what phyſician can reftore him: 
Yet, let the armies form a ring 

And I will fight this Spartan king:

But now the fight is all my own, 

Who falls, it matters not a fig, 

If one ſurvives to dance a jig, 

Upon the poliſh'd iv'ry belly, 

Of that bewitching female Nelly : 

So Trojans bring, (it is our right) 

Two lambs, one black, the other white; 
Black for the earth, white for the ſun,

A third we'll ſacrifice to Jove, 2

But let King Priam's preſence grace

Their ſhining arms the circle round, 

As quick as thought threw on the ground. 


Two trumpets Hector ſent to town, 
To bring his ancient father down : 
Talthybius, with nimble feet, 

Ran a full gallop to the fleet ; 

Leſt Troy ſhould think they meant to

He ran to fetch for Jove the lamb : 

Fly int'rim, fond of miſchief telling, 

The rainbow goddeſs flies to Hellen; 

(Moſt modern farts, I ever knew, 

When ſet on fire, burn only blue, 

Or ſimple red; but when behind, 

The nimble goddeſs lets out wind, 

It leaves a track along the ſkies, 

 Compos'd of fifty different dyes.)

Is that Atrides? quoth the king; 
To me he ſeems the very thing: 
I'm told he is, or grave, or mellow, 
In peace or war a clever fellow. 
Amongſt the Phrygians I have been, 
But ne'er a tighter fellow ſeen. 
When Otreus fill'd the regal throne, © 
And Migdon led their forces on, | 
I and my Trojans join'd the fight, 
And put the Amazons to flight 
Yet far ſuperior in my view, 
Are thoſe that ſtand before us now. 
But tell me, Hellen, if you can, 
Who's that broad-breafted little man; 
His ſhoulders large, and widely ſpread : 
But not fo tall as th' laſt by th' head; 
He is no ſergeant, I've a notion, 
Yet like a ſergeant is his motion : 
He ſeems to take the greateſt ſhare 
Of toil, and orders all with care.

Hellen replies, my judgment miſſes, 
If he you ſpeak of ben't Ulyſſes. 

Now, that I take a better view, 

'Tis he himſelf, I ſpy bim now : 

Let him be ſtanding ſtill, or running, 
You'll hardly find his match for cunning ; 
He knows a thouſand ſlipp'ry tricks, 
But ſhines the moſt in politicks. 

Tho? from a barren iſle he came, 

The world's too little for his fame: 
And, had he not been born a prince, 
He'd been a miniſter long ſince. 


Antenor told the king, he knew 
What Hellen ſaid was very true. 
When Atrius fon and he came over, 
This beauteous female to recover, 

Men of great worth they ſeem'd to be, 
therefore let '*em lodge with me: 

I knew them both before that day, 

And knew they could their reck'ning pay, 


When-

Whene'er we chatted o'er our bowls, 

I mark*d their perſons and their fouls ; 
Atrides ſtanding, look'd the beſt, 

That poſture, youth and bloom expreſs d, 
Seated, Ulyſſes reverence drew: 

On beach he gave the cleareſt view. 
Atrides was no man of talk ; 

But *twas to th* purpoſe when he ſpoke. 
But when Ulyſles deign'd to riſe, 

Upon the ground he fix'd his eyes; 
Look'd like a fool, but yet his ſenſe, 
Commanded ſtreams of eloquence : 

He could, with oily words, I tell ye, 
Make your heart jump within your belly : 
His accent, from the flowers and trees, 
Would call the very birds and bees. 


Then Priam thus: amidſt the throng, 
I ſpy a man exceeding ſtrong ; 
With ſhoulders ſpread, and ſwelling cheſt, 
He's got a giant's back and breaſt : -

This man alone can ſtop an hoſt. 
The next that looks this way to ſee us; 


With my good man he once took quar- 
ter, 
And Iook'd fo trim, my mouth did water. 
The reſt I know, and all could name; 
They're hearts of oak, and men of fame. 
Caſtor and Pollux on the plain 
I've ſought, and ſought, but all in vain: 
We're near a-kin to one another, 
Born of and ſuckled by one mother. 
Perhaps the colonels fight no more, 
At leaſt they fight not for a whore. 
Poor Hellen dreamt not on her bed, 
Her brothers were as herrings dead : 


HOME R'S ILIADS. 169 


That they had each a marble tomb, 
And ſlept ſecure from beat of drum. 


The heralds now with prudent care, 
The deſtin'd ſacrifice prepare: 
But firſt in order form the ring, 
And thus they call the Trojan king: 
Ariſe, O king, come down with ſpeed, 
And lend a hand in time of need; 
To ſeal the truce; for there's no troth, 
Unleſs you come and take the oath. 
Your ſon and famous Mencelau 
For Nell agree to pull a crow: z 
And he that makes his rival yield, 
Or kills him dead upon the field,

T' enjoy the fair with all her treaſure

With that, the viftims by the crown 

He ſeiz'd, and inſtant knock'd them

They ſtruggl'd hard to keep their breath, 
But yielded to the ſtroke of death. 
Of mingled wine they drank one round, 
And pour'd the reſt upon the ground.

Hear Jove, and all ye gods on high, 


Whoſe vicars ſay you hate a lye, 

(Tho' amongſt them for lies and ſwearing, 
There's ſcarce a barrel better herring) 
Whoe'er to break this league combine, 
Pour out their blood like this red wine; 
And may their wives ſuch harlots be, 
That all the pariſh can't ſerve three.

Now when theſe holy rites were done, 

Old Priam haſt'ned ro be gone. 

Too much, quoth he, for my great age, 
To ſee my darling ſon engage: 

But Jove knows beſt, who rules us all, 
What prince ſhall live, or who ſhall fall. 
To ſtay within yon walls I chuſe, 

And be the laſt to hear bad news; 

Then inſtantly his car aſcended, 
Antenor by his fide attended: 

But firſt, and rightly did he judge it, 
He ſtuft the victims in his budget. 


Ulyſſes then, and Hector ſtout, 

The limits of the fight mark'd out: 

Which heroe firſt ſnould throw his lance, 

They both agreed to put to chance. 

The people pray on bended knees, 

And mutter out ſuch words as theſe: 

O Jupiter! who haſt by odds, 
The greateſt head of all the gods, 

Let not the author of this ſtrife 


Depart, and carry back his life :

And ſent full gallop to Old Nick: 
Such rogues once hang'd, all wars would 

ceaſe, 
And ſoldiers eat their bread in peace, 


Hector a brazen helmet takes, 

In which the doubtful lot he ſhakes, 

Then turns his head without deceit, 

To ſhew them that he ſcorn'd to cheat : 

Shakes well the lots ; out pops the caſt 

For Paris, who now arms in haſte. 

He faſten'd on his boots with ſtraps, 

To keep his tender ſhins from raps: 

To guard his am'rous heart he plac'd, 

His ſhining corſlet o'er his breaft, 

His truſty ſword a croſs his breech + 

Was hung, to be within his reach. 

A horſe's tail, juſt like a mop, .

Thus arm'd compleat, he ſtruts about ;

Ready for fight, they both look'd four, 
Andey'd each other o'er and o'er. 

Paris puts on a warlike phiz, 

And from his hand his lance goes whiz ; 
Which lent Atrides' ſhield a thump, 
And then upon the ground fell plump. 
His ſpear, with aim both good and true,

May'ſt pleaſe my good deſign to help,

That men may ceaſe to do amils,

Whiz goes his jav'lin thro? the air:

At ſingle gulp he'd ſwallow thee;

But ſince thou'rt out of danger, ſtay.” 


Paris replies, my dear, ha? done, 
Who can recall the ſetting ſun ?

Tho! Menelau a conqueſt made, 

You know it was by Pallay' aid; 

The next bout I may luckier be, | 
And then I'll drub his hide, you'll ſee; 

But haſte, my charmer, let's employ 
Our moments in th' affair of joy;

Something alive ſtirs like an eel. 

I now have far more appetite,

In Cranac's iſle I fought love's fight.

But up he jump'd upon the bed; | 
Where Nelly follow'd, and as wont,

By that ſame ſpot he never caught her,

Enthron'd the gods in council ſat, 
Bright Hebe, gay immortal laſs, 
With ſparkling nectar fill'd each glaſs; 
The friendly bumpers round they tip, 
And talk of Troy at ev'ry ſip: 
When thus for fun, unlucky Jove, 
Provok'd his ox-ey'd ſcolding love;

To help her letcher ſcowers along; 

With nimble bum, or nimbler wriſt, _ 
She guides his weapon where ſhe liſt ; 
Nay more, a touch of her ſoft hand, 
If fallen down, will make him ſtand. 


But now, ye powers, ſince we've be-

The book of fate then let us ſcan, 

And view what is ordain'd for man; 

That we about them may determine, 

To kill, or keep alive the vermin: 

Say then, ſhall ſmiling peace enſue,

harping on that word: we judge from thence, 
ſhe came in for ſmall ſhare of the labours of theſe 
whoring Trojans ; but Venus did. There was 
one Anchiſes, a twice five-finger'd Trojan, that

For Jove to fight, and fave you toil : 

But you will find, without a jeſt,

He march'd, and ſtrutted round the ring.

To ſee him head his regiment : 


And to obſerve, how void of fear,

The ſergeant majors in their places,

And made 'em face both in and out; 
Then turn upon the centre quick, - 

As eaſy as a juggler's trick;

That phalanx might be truſted to.

Had con'd a ſpeech; and thus he ſaid : 
To ſay Pm pleas'd, O gallant knight,

Thy ſoldiers well may heroes be, 

When they ſuch bright examples ſee. 
Would Jove but breathe into the reſt, 
Such fire as burns within thy breaſt,

Trojans would helter-ſkelter run, 
And Troy from high come tumbling 
down. 


The next he found was ancient Neſtor, 
Who ſpite of age, was ſtill a jeſter: 
For military art renown'd, 
As Bland's his knowledge was profound; 
Beſides, when he thought fit, could 

ſpeak 

In any langurge — beſt in Greek. 
The king eſpy'd his men in ranks, 
And flew to give the vet'ran thanks: 
Obſerv'd how juſt he plac'd his forces, 
His footmen and his line of horſes. 
The“ foot were wiſely rang'd in front, 
That they the firſt might bear the brunt. 


11 imagine, the author has placed the troops 
as he thinks they ſhould be, not as they were. 
'The author knows the Grecians had no horſes 
but what — uſed to their chariots: but, as he 


talks like an apothecary, he gives himſelf what 
liberty he pleaſes,

To keep em ready to purſue,

Half hearts of cock, half hearts of hen. 


The very riff- raff rogues they venture, 


To ſqueeze together in the centre. | 
Thus fix'd, they kept a ſharp look- out, 
And ready ſtood to buckle to't. 

Now, what a fine old Greek was he, 


A finer Grecian could not be, 


Who in ſo ſmall a ſpace could muſter, 
And form his lines without a cluſter. 
Then to each liſt'ning leering knave, 
A little ſound advice he gave: 

If you in battle chance to fall, 


Don't ſtay to riſe, for that ſpoils all; 


To riſe as ſome men do, I mean, 


A —ſe foremoſt, then your back is ſeen; 


But riſe directly bolt upright, 


Ready prepar'd to run, or fight. 
Our fatners by theſe rules became 
Immortal, you may do the ſame,
