But it is more probable that it owes its 
name to Pallas, whom the Greeks call 
AOfjvfi, though we muft not attribute this de- 
nomination to the fabulous difpute betwixt 
(23) Neptune and Pallas ; but to (24) Am- 
phiftyon's dedication of the city to the pa- 
tronage of Minerva, A6yiv7ig, which is the 
name of that goddefs, and feems to be de- 
rived from the (25) Egyptian tongue. 

IX, The pre-eminent title of A^ was 
likewife given to Athens. Hence we often 
find, not only in the Greek, but alfo in 
the Latin writers, A^v (26) inflead of 
Athens.

Thracians, to whom they were indebted 
for the name of rtligion, ©fiya>6«<«; and 
partly from the colonies of different (3) 
nations which fettled amongfl them. 

IL The firil Greeks^ and many other 
nations^ paid divine worfhip to the fky, to 
the fun, to the moon» to the ftars^ and to 
the (4) earth. And as they faw that con- 
tinual motion was a property of thefe bo- 
dies, they termed them Beouc, from the 
verb (5) ^iu¥, to run: though the word, 
perhaps, may be derived from another (6) 
root. 

III. They afterwards adopted into their 
language the names of the (7) Egyptian 
gods. The worftiip of the gods of other 
i^i.iHtivns was edablifhed in procefs of

XL But in time thefe reprefentations 
were more ingenioufly wrought. A (27) 
human form was giyen them, and they 
were called (28) Bjitij. At firft their feet 
(29) touched each other; afterwards they

places of the woods, the temples, and the 
religious ceremonies. The general appeU 
lation of the priefts was,, (i) *Ugiig ; they 
were held in great (2) veneration. 

II. There were different clafles of them 
in the (3) great cities. He who was at 
the head of the whole order, and whofe 
province it was to celebrate the moft ft- 
cred myfteries, was* called (4) A^it^ivg 
[the High Prieft.] The priefts had their 
miniflers, whofe names correfponded with 
their (5) different fundions. 

III. Amongft the Greeks, the women, 
as well as the men, were admitted to ft-- 
cred fundlions. The prieffeflcs were called

IV. Thus thepriefteffesof (9) Minerva, 
of (10) Cybele, of (11) Ceres, and of 

(12) Venus, were virgins. Thofe of Ce- 
res were diftinguifhed by the name of 

(13) MeXio-o-ai.— This title was likewile 
given to other (14) priefteflcs. 

V. They were enjoined a perpetual 
(15) chaflity. Hence, in later times they 
were not admitted to the /acred order till 
they were (16) marriageable. 

VI. Women who had had more than 
one hufband, were excluded on that ac-* 
count from fome facerdotal (17) claflcs. 

VIL The pricfteflcs ufed to carry the 
diflindive emblems of the deity to whom 
they were (18) confecrated. 

VIII. At (19) Athens, the priefts and 
prieftefles were drawn by lot from the

C H A P. IX. 

Of the Oracle 8 and Divina- 
tions of the Greeks. 

I. 'TT^HE divinations and the oracles 
jL made likewife a part of their re- 
ligion. The anfwers which the Gods 
gave when they were confulted in doubtful 
and difficult cafes, were the oracles. Thofe 
anfwers were termed v%^ijt/mij from the 
verb, (i) xi^»9 to give an oracular*anfwer. 
They were alfo called, (2) Xoy/a, (3) ptF- 
rmJiAaret, (4) SiovpoT^a, &c. The placea 
where thefe oracles were anounced, were 
called, (5) xgK^S*^9 (6) fcctvreia; the divin- 
ers, xpfi-fioXoyoh ; and to confult them, was 
cxprefled^by the word, (8) ;(jf«<rflai. 

IL The oracles had gained fuch credit 
and veneration, that they were confulted 
in all important affairs, on all (9) doubt- 
ful events* Their anfwers were deemed

the advice of heaven ; they were received 
with an (lo) implicit faith. In fhott,, if 
a(i I ) form of govemnMnt was^tobe chang- 
ed, if (12) laws were to be made, if (13) 
war was to be declared, or peaee concluded, 
they entered upon none of thefe important 
matters without firft confulting the o* 
facles. 

III. The venerttion £m the oracles was 
augmented by the gifts and facrifices wfiic^ 
they who oonfulted them were obliged (9 
ofier. Princes and rich men, fortlMitrea* 
fon, could otdy (14) confult thcmi iior 
could they at anytime; but «po« oertaki 

(15) days. 

IV. Were thefe wrfwcrs dilated by 

(16) demons? or were they only the re- 
falt of the art and villatny of the priefls ? 
This is yet a problem wk h the learned. I, 
however, am of opinion that they were tlie 
efFed of dexterity and artifice. 

V. Of the Gods who prefided over orz^ 
cles, and divinations, the moft eminent 
were, (17) Jupiter, and (i3) Apollo*

TI. Ali the oracles were not delivered 
in tht ikme manner, in fome places the 
anfwers were given by (19) interpreters. 
Iq others^ the Gods themfelves revealed 
their will* either by (^o) voice, or (21) 
dreams* or ibme dfccifive (22) events. But 
I muft give a particular defcription of fome 
of the tna& famous oracles.

II. It is faid, the Pelafgians built Dodo«

III. There are different conjeAures on

derive it from Dodanim, the ion of Javan^ 
who, they fay, fettled a colony in that part 
of (5) Epirus—Others from the river (6) 
Dodona'— Others from the Dodonean 
dove, or rather from a woman named Do-

fountains ; but a torch not lighted took 
fire at fome diftance from its water.

CHAP. XL 
Of the Delphic Oracle. 

I, ' I ^HE Delphic oracle was the moft 
X ( I ) famous of them all. It gave 
its.anfwers at Delphi^ a city of (2) Phocis. 
In that city was the famous temple of (3) 
Pythian Apollo, enriched with treafure» 
and (4) offerings. The place in which 
the oracles were delivered, was called, (5) 
The Pythian ; the pricftcfs who delivered 
them, (6) Pythia; and the games in ho- 
nour of Apollo, (7) The Pythian Games. 

IL Different origins are given to the 
word, Pythian. Etymologifts derive it 
from the ferpent (8) Python, or from the 
verb, (9) 7an)9i(r9ai, to confult, or from (10) 
'ovdecrOui, to rot ; but its true root is mBia, 
which is a name of the city of (1 1) Del- 
phi. 

III. This oracle was very ancient. It 

flourished about a hundred years before the

firft gave the oracles here. But (he re^ 
£gned that privilege to (13) Apollo. 

IV. Some authors have aflerted that a 
fiock of goats gave rife to this oracle. They 
tell us that on mount Parnaflus there was 
a deep cave, the entrance to which was 
narrow; that the goats^ when they ap- 
proached this entrance, began to ikip and 
fcream ; that the goat«herd, while he was 
furprifed at that prodigy^ ibund himfelf 
feized with a kind of fury, a divine en- 
thufiafm, which opened futurity to his 
view i that a tripod was placed at the o« 
pening of the cavern, and a temple built 
(14) there. 

V. To the following particulars, how- 
ler, we may give credit.— -In the fanftua- 
ry of the temple there was a deep cave, 
from which a cold exhalation iiTued that 
mounted high into the ( 1 5) air. 

VI. At the opening of this cave there 
was a tripod, which was called {16) %fii-

Of the Oracle of T r o p h o n i u Si 

I. ' I ^HrS famous oracle of Trophohius 
A was in the neighbourhood of Le- 
badia, a city of (i) Bceotia, near to which 
was a woodj and the (2) oracle, on an e^^ 
minence that overlooked the wood. 

II. It takes its name from Trophonius* 
the brother of (3) Agamedes, who lived 
near Leb^dia, in a fubterranean dwellings 
where he pretended to the faculty of pre- 
dicting future events. He died iti that 
cave, and after his death he was deified 
as an (4) oracular God. 

III. This oracle owed its fame to one 
Saon, mentioned by (5) Paufanias. 

IV. It was in a cave; ^ndfrom its 
£tuation took the name of (6) KaraCao^wv* 

V. Peculiar ceremonies of purification 
were to be performed by the perfon who 
came to confult the oracle* He was to of-

fer appointed facrifices; he was to anoint 
himfelf with oil, and bathe in a certain 
river. After thcfe preliminaries^ iclotbed 
in a linen robe, and with a honeyed cake 
in bis hands, he defcended into the cave 
by a narrow (7) paflage. 

VI. It was in this cave that futurity was 
difclpfcd to him, by fight, or by (8) hearing. 

VIL He came out of the cave by the 
fame narrow paifage, but walking (9) 
backwards. 

VIII. He came out of it aftoniflicd, 
melancholy, and (10) dejedled. This fi- 
tuation of mind gave* rife to the Greek - 
proverb — ( 11) Ei^ r^o^mm fi^iioLVTBD^rotu 

IX. The priefts placed the perfon who 
had confulted the oracle on an elevated 
feat, called the feat of Mnemofyne i where 
he gave them an account of what he had 
feen and (12) heard. 

X. His companions then conducted him 
to the chapel of good genius , or good for- 
tune^ where by degrees he recovered his 
ufual compofure and (13) cheerfulnefs.

fonuc important benefit, and to celebrate 
their (i) praifes; or in memory of the 
dead who had done fignal fervices to their

fmall number of feftivals. There were 
but a very few more than thofe which 
were celebrated after the harveft, and the

'CHAP. XXIL 

Of the four folemn Games of Greece, 

I. ' I ^HERE were four folemn games 
' JL in Greece, copfecrated by reli- 
gion, and on that account called'(i) ocyonyB^ 
U^oi. They were, the Olympic, the Py- 
thian, the Ifthmian, and the Nemean 
games, which only differed from each other 
by the places in which they were (a) cele-* 
bra ted. 

IL The Olympic games were celebrated 
in honour of (3) Olympian Jupiter, at O-p 
lympia, a city of (4) Elis, from which they 
took their name. 

III. Their origin is attributed to (5) 
Hercules, one of the (6) Idaei Daftyli. 

IV. They returned every (7) five years, 
and lafted (8) five days, 

V. Thefe games were omitted a (hort 
time aft?r their firft inftitution, but were

afterwards renewed by (9) Iphitus; and 
from the time when he reftorcd them, the 
Greeks counted the 6rft (10) Olympiad. 

VL The people of (1 1)' Pifa, or (12) E^ 
lis, had the care of ihefc games ; but coqi- 
monly the (13) Eleans. 

VII. There were public officers appoint- 
ed to condudt the games, and tofcize thofc 
who fhould difturb the celebration of them. 
They were called ccXutui by the Eleans, a- 
mong whom they exercifed the fame func- 
tion with thatof the'pa£J»;)COi, lidors, in the 
other ftates ( 1 4) of Greece. The chief of 
tbcfe Alutaewas called (15) aXirrccox'^jg. 

VIII. In the more ancient times, women 
were not permitted to fee thefe (16) games. 
But afterwards there were even female 
combatants ; and hiftory ^mentions fome 
women who gained the (17) prize. 

IX. He who chofe to be a competitor at 
thefe games, and gave in his (18) name, 
was to prepare himfelf (19) ten months 
beforehand. Nine months were employed

X. People branded with any infamy, or 
their friends, or relations, were not allowed 
to combat at ihefe (21) games. 

XL The matches at \hefe pombats wcrp 
determined by lots in the following man-?

into a filver vafc, termed (2:?) Ka^^ic. on 
each of which a letter of the alphabet was 
written. They who drew the fame letter

Of ike Pythian Games. 

I. ' I ^HE Pythian games were celebrat- 
X ed in honour of (i) Pythiaa A- 
polloi a« (a) Delphi, a city which was 
Kkewile called (3) Iluffw, fVotn which name 
thefe games bad their appellation. 

IL In early timea thefe games were cele« 
Wated every (4) nine years 1 aad that pe« 
riod was called^ ayiotrrifi^i becaufe they re« 
turned at the ninth year^ after the complete 
revolution of eight years. . 

IIL They were afterwards celebrated 
every five years; and that period was called 
(5) wtvTMTij^g. With this change thefe 
games were renewed by the (6) Amphic- 
tyons, after they had been omitted for foma 
time. 

IV. The fame Amphiftyons added the 
contcft of the (7) flute to that of the lyre, 
which had been appointed in ancient times.

gamesi Ilorfe-races and chariot^races made 
a (14) part of the former as well as of the 
feter. At the Pythian games there were 
likewife prizes for (15) intelledual merit. 

VIII. Thefc games were celebrated on 
the fixth day of the month called BvciQ^ by 
the Delphians„ and (16) Btt^X$uv by the 
Athenians; part of which month fell in A-

once more new-modelled. The power of

Of the Food of the Ancient Greeks. 

I. ' I ^ H E principal and moft ncceflary 

JL food» with the ancient Greeks, 

es with us» was bread, which was named,. 

( 1 ) A^Tog. . Hence this word comprehends 

(2) meat and drink. By Homer and 6ther 
.authors, bread is likewife metonymically 
termed, (4) Siro^ 

IL Bread was generally carried in a 
wicker-bafket, called, (5) ILoofuv, zecpovp. 

III. Their loaves were baked either un*- 
der the afhes, and then they were termed^ 
(6) ZTTo^tTou afro*— (7) Eyx^u^/oi— -or in an 
oyeni Kp£oivea ;^^^2ind then they were called^ 
(8) K^iCocviTau 

IV. The Greeks had another kind of 
bread, named Ma^a, which was made with 
a coarfcr flour, with fait and water; to 
W'hich ingredients fbme added (9) oil.

V. Barley-meal was alfb much ufcd by 
them ;— ^in Greek it was AX^/roy— In Latin 
— (10) Polenta. 

VI. The B^iov was a compofition of rice, 
cheefc, eggs^ and boney. It was wrapped 
in fig-leaves — whence it took its (11) 
name. 

VII. The MvTTUTov was made with 
checfe, garlick, and eggs, (12) beaten and 
mixed together. 

VIII. The poor people made their bread 
hollow, in form of a plate; and into the 
hollow they poured a fauce. This fort of 
bread was called, (13) M/g-uXX^, whence 
comes the verb (14) M/^T^XXcwrflai. The 
poor Athenians lived likewife on garJick 
and (15) onions. 

IX. The Greeks had many forts of cakes 
—(16) nupapu^— (17) Diytra/Aouff— (18) A- 
pXo^— (19) iTf/fli— (20) MfiXiTTOura— (21)

conclude that the Greeks difliked animal 
food. — They ate flefli commonly {zzy 
roafled, feldom boiled; efpecially id the 

(23) heroical times of Greece. 

XL At Lacedsmon the young people 
ate animal-food. A black foup, termed 

(24) MiX«^ ^vfio^ — fupportcd the men and 
the old people. 

XII. The poor ate likewife (25) graf- 
hoppers, and the (26) extremities of leaves. 

XIII. The (27) Greeks were likewife 
great lovers of fi(h ; a food^ which, how-* 
ever, we do not find on the tables of Ho* 
mer's (28) heroes. 

XIV. They were fond of eels drefled 
with beet-root — ^This di(h they called-— 
(29) Ey%6Xi*^ ivr€TVTXu»ZfUveci. 

XV. They liked falt-fifh, of which the 
joll, and the belly were their (30) favourite 
parts.

Qf their Manner of Burying and 
Burning their Dead. 

I. T N the early times they buried their 
X (1) dead. This was their coftom 
in the days of (2) Cecrops, 

11. The body was laid horizontally in the 
coffin, with the head to the Weft, that it 
might look to the rifing fun. Such was 
the cuftoni of the Athenians, and the other 
Greeks^ except the Megarenfes, who laid 
their dead bodies in the (3) oppofite pofi*

introduced by (4) Hercules, after his^

L ' I ^HE Greeks ufcd to inter their 
X dead without their (i) cities^ 
commonly by the (2) fides of their ^igb* 
ways, that they might not be polluted by 
touching a (3) corpfe, nor incommoded by 
its (4) fmcIL 

II. We read, however, that they fome* 
times buried their dead in an elevated part 
of a city. But this was an honorary diftinc* 
tion, payed to thofe who had been of im«> 
portant fervice to their (5) country « 

III. Lycurgus permitted the Lacedasmo-- 
nians to bury their dead in the city, and 
even round their (6) temples. 

IV. They prayed that the earth might 
lie light on their friends^ and ilJuftrious 
(7) men— -and that on their enemies, and 
the wicked, it might be (8) heavy and
